## Executive Summary

The site has strong bones. The Pistons palette is emotionally resonant, the CSS token system is comprehensive (26 custom properties, zero inline hex), and Arena Mode is a genuinely cool feature that works well. The Grind team shipped solid engineering.

But the design hasn't been designed yet. It's been built — competently — without a unifying vision for how a 14-year-old experiences math practice. The result is a functional tool that feels institutional where it should feel personal, overwhelming where it should feel focused, and inconsistent where it should feel like one product.

**Verdict:** Don't start over. Refine. The token system, the stripe motif, the Arena Mode — those are keepers. The issues are in information architecture, hierarchy, and emotional tone.

## What Works

### 1. The Token System ✅
26 CSS custom properties. Zero hardcoded hex across 19 HTML files. `shared/styles.css` at 1025 lines is a real design system file. The Grind team did the migration work and it shows — every color, shadow, and border references a token. This is professional-grade CSS architecture.

### 2. The Pistons Palette ✅
`--accent-red: #C8102E`, `--accent-blue: #1D42BA`, `--accent-navy: #002D62`. These aren't random brand colors — they carry meaning. Red = Detroit. Blue = trust. Navy = depth. The palette works because it means something to the family using it.

### 3. The Jersey Stripe ✅
The red-blue gradient line under the header is the single best brand element on the site. It instantly says "this is Motor City Math" without a logo, without a tagline. It's confident. Keep it on every page.

### 4. Arena Mode ✅
Dark theme (`#0A0E1A` page, `#141B2D` cards) is well-executed. Accent colors adjust properly (`#E8334A` red, `#4A72E8` blue). Text contrast is good. The toggle works. The fact that a dad-built math app has a dark mode called "Arena Mode" is delightful — it makes test-taking feel like a competition, not a chore.

### 5. Category Badges (test.html) ✅
The `NONLINEAR-FUNCTIONS` (red), `W3.E` (blue), `MEDIUM` (yellow/green) badges on the dynamically-generated test page are excellent. They give Kai instant context: what topic, what standard, what difficulty. This pattern should be on every test page, not just the generated ones.

### 6. KaTeX Math Rendering ✅
Math expressions render cleanly in both light and dark modes. The font pairing (KaTeX_Main + Helvetica Neue body) works. No rendering glitches in screenshots.

## Critical Issues

### C1. Exam Error State Exposed to Users
**Page:** exam.html
**What:** When loaded without a `?file=` parameter, shows "Loading... — Motor City Math" with 28 elements and what appears to be a loading/error state. Title says "Loading..." — a user landing here accidentally gets a broken experience.
**Fix:** Show a friendly message: "Pick a test to get started" with links to available exams. Or redirect to index.html.

### C2. Times New Roman Leaking into Every Page
**Data:** Every single page reports `"Times New Roman"` as a computed font alongside the intended `"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` stack.
**Cause:** Likely KaTeX's serif fallback (`KaTeX_Main, "Times New Roman", serif`) bleeding into parent elements, or the browser's default serif showing on elements that don't inherit the body font.
**Impact:** Creates a subtle but real "this looks like a school worksheet" feeling. Times New Roman is the most institutional font in existence.
**Fix:** Audit which elements are rendering in Times. Explicitly set `font-family: inherit` on KaTeX container wrappers. The math itself should use KaTeX fonts — the surrounding UI should not.

### C3. No Shared Navigation Component
**Data:** 20 HTML files, 20 independent header structures.
**Impact:** "← Back to Dashboard" appears in different positions (top, bottom, sometimes both, sometimes neither). Some pages have it as a link, others as a button. Kai has to hunt for how to get home.
**Fix:** One `<header>` pattern: logo/title left, timer right (if applicable), back arrow always top-left. Extract to a shared include or template.

---

## High Priority

### H1. Dashboard Information Overload
**Page:** index.html — 1880px tall, 100 elements, 7+ sections
**Sections visible:** Score History graph, Standards Breakdown (expandable), What to Study Next, Retake Practice, navigation buttons (4), Quick Tests (4 cards), All Tests (14 items), Send Scores to Dad.
**Problem:** A 14-year-old opening this sees everything at once. There's no hierarchy saying "do this next." The CTAs compete — "Take the Test" (red), "Practice Mode" (outline), "Test Builder" (outline), "Parent View" (outline) are all the same visual weight except the red one.
**Recommendation:** Progressive disclosure. Above the fold: one primary action ("Your next test"), current streak/score, and the jersey stripe. Everything else is expandable or on secondary screens. The dashboard should answer ONE question: "What should I do right now?"

### H2. Button Hierarchy is a Color Zoo
**Pages:** test-builder.html (4 buttons: white, blue, green, text-link), index.html (red + 3 outline), practice.html
**Problem:** No consistent button hierarchy. What's primary? What's secondary? What's destructive? The colors don't communicate a system — they communicate "each button was styled independently."
**Recommendation:** Three tiers max:
- **Primary** (red, filled): The ONE thing to do on this screen
- **Secondary** (navy outline): Alternative actions
- **Ghost** (text only): Navigation/back
Everything else is a link, not a button.

### H3. Font Size Proliferation
**Data:** index.html alone uses 11 distinct font sizes (12.92px, 13.6px, 15.2px, 15.84px, 16.8px, 16px, 17.6px, 18.4px, 19.76px, 40px, 44px). Cross-site: 22+ unique sizes.
**Problem:** A type scale should have 5-7 steps. 22 sizes means there's no scale — each element was sized by eye.
**Recommendation:** Lock to a modular scale. Proposed:
- `--text-xs`: 12px (captions, labels)
- `--text-sm`: 14px (secondary text)
- `--text-base`: 16px (body, questions)
- `--text-lg`: 20px (section headers)
- `--text-xl`: 28px (page subtitles)
- `--text-2xl`: 40px (page titles)

Six sizes. Everything fits into one of these.

### H4. Arena Mode Toggle Inconsistency
**Observation:** Some pages appear to default to Arena Mode (test.html viewport screenshot is dark), while others default to light. The toggle button is a floating icon with no label.
**Problem:** If Kai prefers Arena Mode, he has to toggle it on every page. No persistence. No system preference detection.
**Recommendation:** Persist the theme choice in `localStorage`. Respect `prefers-color-scheme` as default. Label the toggle — a first-time user doesn't know what the basketball icon does.

---

## Medium Priority

### M1. Section Headers Feel Institutional
**Examples:** "SCORE HISTORY", "STANDARDS BREAKDOWN", "WHAT TO STUDY NEXT", "ALL TESTS"
**Problem:** ALL CAPS + letter-spacing = standardized test vibes. This is a dad-built app for his son. It should feel encouraging, not like the SAT.
**Recommendation:** Title case, slightly larger, maybe with a subtle emoji or icon. "Score History" not "SCORE HISTORY." "What to Study Next 📚" not "WHAT TO STUDY NEXT."

### M2. Empty States Are Placeholder-Quality
**Examples:** "No scores yet. Take your first test." / "No standard data yet. Complete a test to see your breakdown."
**Problem:** These are developer strings, not designed moments. The first time Kai opens the app, EVERY section shows an empty state. That's his first impression.
**Recommendation:** Make empty states encouraging. "Ready to start? Your first score goes right here. 🏀" The empty state IS the onboarding.

### M3. Inconsistent Page Titles
**Data:** Titles vary between:
- "Motor City Math — Dashboard" ✅
- "Motor City Math — Unit Test" ✅
- "Algebra 2 - Linear Functions Practice Test" ❌ (no MCM brand)
- "Algebra II - Exponents Mastery Exam" ❌ (different format)
- "Non-Linear Functions Test" ❌ (no brand at all)
**Recommendation:** Every page: "Motor City Math — [Page Name]". Consistent in the `<title>` tag and the `<h1>`.

### M4. Question Card Left-Border Color Inconsistency
**Observation:** Newer pages (exam, test, nonlinear_exam_mvp) use a blue left border on question cards. The test page uses red borders on sub-question containers. Older pages vary.
**Recommendation:** One rule: question card = blue left border (Pistons blue). Correct/incorrect states use green/red. Red borders should never appear on unanswered questions — it implies "wrong" before the student even tries.

### M5. Print Stylesheet Exists but Needs Polish
**Data:** `shared/print.css` at 213 lines — good separation.
**Observation:** Print-specific overrides exist but some interactive elements (buttons) may still render. The print view should be clean enough for Kai to take a paper test.

---

## Low Priority

### L1. Console Error on linear_functions_test
**Error:** "Failed to create chart: can't acquire context from the given item"
**Impact:** Chart doesn't render. Low priority because this is an older test page.

### L2. Footer Positioning Varies
**Text:** "Built with 💪 by Dad · Motor City Math"
**Issue:** Charming but not consistently placed. Some pages have it, others don't.

### L3. Older Quiz Pages (Nov 2025) Feel Different
**Pages:** quiz_251117, quiz_251120, quiz_251121
**Observation:** These use the shared CSS but were built before the current design patterns matured. They work but feel like a different era of the product.
**Recommendation:** Low priority — they're historical. Focus design energy on the active pages (index, practice, exam, test, test-builder, parent).

## Arena Mode Deep Dive

Arena Mode is the site's most distinctive feature. The dark theme is well-executed:

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Page background | `#0A0E1A` — deep navy, not pure black. Good. |
| Card background | `#141B2D` — distinct from page. Good separation. |
| Text contrast | `#E0E4EB` primary — readable. Passes WCAG AA. |
| Red accents | `#E8334A` — brighter than light-mode red. Smart adaptation. |
| Blue accents | `#4A72E8` — lifted from navy. Works. |
| Jersey stripe | Red-blue gradient reads clearly on dark background. |
| Input fields | Dark backgrounds with visible borders. Functional. |
| KaTeX math | Renders fine in dark mode. |

**Issues in Arena Mode:**
- Sub-question containers use red borders (`--accent-red`) — on dark backgrounds this looks like an error state. Should use `--border-subtle` or a muted navy.
- The "HOW TO ENTER ANSWERS" box uses a blue dashed border that competes with the question card borders. Should be subtler.
- Badge colors (EASY = green, MEDIUM = yellow) need contrast checks against `#141B2D`.

## Design Direction

**Critical user context: Kai has ADHD.** Every design decision must account for this. Fewer choices, clearer hierarchy, less visual noise, one action at a time. This isn't just good design — it's accessibility for the actual user of this product.

This app has a clear identity that hasn't been fully expressed yet. Here's the direction:

### The Feeling
Motor City Math should feel like **a coach, not a classroom**. Kai should open it and feel like his dad built something just for him — because he did. The Pistons branding, the "Arena Mode," the basketball icon — these all point toward competition, pride, personal challenge. Lean into that.

### Three Principles for MCM

1. **Focus over features.** When Kai is taking a test, nothing else exists. No navigation, no scores, no dashboard widgets. Just the question, the input, and the timer. Everything else hides. *ADHD context: competing visual elements are not just clutter — they're active distractions that pull focus from the math.*

2. **Encourage over evaluate.** Empty states, headers, feedback — all should feel like a coach talking to a player. "Ready for round 2?" not "RETAKE PRACTICE." "You nailed 12 out of 15" not "Score: 80%." *ADHD context: positive framing sustains motivation. Clinical framing triggers avoidance.*

3. **One thing at a time.** The dashboard should say "here's what to do next." The test should show one question prominently. The results should celebrate before analyzing. Don't make a 14-year-old parse information architecture. *ADHD context: choice overload causes decision paralysis. Reduce options to reduce friction.*

### ⚠️ CORRECTION (2026-02-19): Site Simplified Since Review

**This review was conducted against the live GitHub Pages deployment, which still serves 20 HTML files. However, GA completed a simplification pass and the repo now contains only 5 files:**

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| **index.html** | Active — dashboard |
| **exam.html** | Active — dynamic exam loader |
| final_exam_251123.html | Archive candidate |
| final_exam_251123_mini.html | Archive candidate |
| nonlinear_exam_mvp.html | Archive candidate |

**Deleted (no longer in repo):** practice.html, test.html, test-builder.html, parent.html, index_calc.html, linear_functions_test.html, nonlinear_functions_test.html, exponents_exam.html, unit2_nonlinear_review.html, quiz_251117.html, quiz_251120.html, quiz_251121.html, 20260119_Exponents_Unit1.html (+ 2nd, 3rd), test.html

**Impact on task list:** Scope is dramatically smaller. Shared header = 2 pages, not 6. Archive treatment = 3 pages, not 14. Many findings (button hierarchy on test-builder, navigation inconsistency across 20 pages) may no longer apply. The design principles, type scale, ADHD constraints, and Arena Mode persistence remain fully relevant.

### What to Do First (REVISED)

| # | Action | Owner | Impact |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Fix exam.html error state — friendly test picker, not broken page | GA | Critical — users hitting a dead page |
| 2 | Fix Times New Roman leak — `font-family: inherit` on KaTeX wrappers | GA | Critical — institutional feeling on all 5 pages |
| 3 | Lock type scale to 6 sizes as CSS tokens (`--text-xs` through `--text-2xl`) | GD | High — apply to index.html + exam.html |
| 4 | Consistent header on index.html + exam.html (logo left, timer right, back top-left) | GA | High — only 2 active pages now |
| 5 | Archive mode for 3 legacy tests (`body.archived` class, inputs locked, banner) | GA | Medium — small scope, add CSS class to 3 files |
| 6 | Establish button hierarchy — primary (red), secondary (navy outline), ghost (text) | GD | High — apply to index.html + exam.html |
| 7 | Redesign dashboard (index.html) above-the-fold — one primary action, progressive disclosure | GD | High — ADHD: reduces decision paralysis |
| 8 | Persist Arena Mode in localStorage — one toggle, site-wide, all 5 pages | GA | High — jarring light/dark switch between pages |
| 9 | Red borders → blue on unanswered questions. Red only after grading. | GD | Medium — ADHD: red = wrong signal before trying |
| 10 | Warm up section headers — title case, emoji, coach tone ("Up Next 🏀") | GD | Medium — Pistons personality, not SAT vibes |
| 11 | Coach voice for empty states ("Let's get your first score on the board. 🏀") | GD | Medium — first impression matters |
| 12 | New test titles = curriculum-based ("Unit 2: Nonlinear Functions — W2 & W3") | GD | Medium — for future tests generated by exam.html |
| 13 | Print: expand writing space (2-3x for handwriting), clean chrome removal | GA/GD | Medium — Kai uses paper tests |
| 14 | Print: page break control for double-sided-friendly layout, page numbers | GA | Low — nice-to-have for paper flow |

**Notes:**
- Only 2 active pages need the shared header and full design treatment.
- 3 archive pages get `body.archived` CSS class — minimal work.
- Design principles (ADHD, coach voice, Pistons personality, type scale) apply to all current AND future pages.
- Double-sided printing is a printer setting — we optimize layout for it but can't force it.
