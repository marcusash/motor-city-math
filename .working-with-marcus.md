# Working with Marcus — Guide for All Agents

**Adapted from:** Inkwell application-agent (250+ interactions, 11 rounds)
**Project:** Motor City Math
**Last updated:** 2026-02-17
**Context:** These patterns were learned across the Inkwell project (6 agents, 229 commits, 529 tests) and apply directly to Motor City Math.

## Who Marcus Is

Marcus is the creator of Motor City Math. He's a senior technology executive (CVP of Design at Microsoft, leading 220 designers) who built 12 HTML practice tests for his 15-year-old son Kai. He's technically literate — he understands code, architecture, and systems — but he works through us to build. Kai is actively using these tests to study Algebra II.

## How Marcus Works

### He leads by showing, not specifying

Marcus rarely writes detailed requirements docs. Instead, he:
- **Takes screenshots** of the running app and annotates what's wrong
- **Describes what he wants** conversationally, in voice-to-text style (long flowing sentences)
- **References how things used to work** — "this used to look good" is a specific, valuable signal
- **Sends images** of real content (test files, Kai's worksheets) as test cases

**What this means for you:** Don't wait for formal specs. Build something, show him, iterate. He'll tell you what's wrong faster than he'll write what's right.

### He trusts his memory — and he's usually correct

Multiple times during development, Marcus flagged regressions by saying "this used to work." Every time, he was right.

**What this means for you:** When Marcus says something changed or regressed, your first move should be `git log` and `git diff`, not trying a new approach. Trust his perception.

### He's hands-on but delegates execution

Marcus actively tests, gives feedback, takes screenshots, and makes design decisions. But he delegates all implementation to agents. He won't write code himself — he'll describe what he wants and expect you to build it.

He'll also:
- Ask you to brainstorm approaches before committing
- Make you justify decisions ("why not X?")
- Push back if something doesn't feel right
- Send you to research if your first attempt isn't good enough

### He's direct about quality

If something looks bad, Marcus will say so. He's not harsh — he's precise. He knows what good looks like because he and Kai use the tests regularly.

**What this means for you:** Don't ship work that's "probably fine." Test with real content, not synthetic data. Open the HTML in a browser. If your output looks wrong to you, it'll definitely look wrong to him.

## Communication Expectations

### Response format

- **Be concise.** Marcus processes a lot of information across 6 agents. Don't write essays. Lead with what you did and what he needs to see/decide.
- **Show screenshots or describe visuals** when you change the UI.
- **When you have questions, ask them one at a time.** Don't bundle 5 questions into one message. Use the "Questions / Decisions Needed from Marcus" section in `.marcus-queue.md`.

### Formatting for status updates and action items

Don't use markdown tables or complex formatting — they render poorly in the terminal. Marcus runs ~80-column windows side by side. Tables wrap, pipe characters break, and the content becomes unreadable.

**The rule: never use markdown tables in terminal output to Marcus.** Tables are fine in `.md` files meant for agents (`.agent-status.md`, `.design-system.md`), but any text that renders in Marcus's terminal must use the formats below.

#### Status report template

When Marcus asks for status, use this structure:

```
✅ Done (N tasks)
  D-1 Visual audit · D-2 Color audit · D-3 Design system
  D-4 WritingScreen layout · D-5 Title fix · D-6 Scroll indicators

🔨 In progress
  1. **Task name** — one-line description of what you're doing

📋 Up next
  1. **Task name** — one-line description
  2. **Task name** — one-line description

🚫 Blocked
  **Task name** — what's blocking it, who can unblock
```

Rules:
- Done items compress onto comma/dot-separated lines (they're history, not action)
- In-progress and next items get one numbered line each with bold topic
- Keep descriptions under 60 characters
- Group by status, not by chronological order
- If nothing is blocked, omit that section

#### Action items and choices

When presenting options or decisions:

```
1. **Bold topic** — short description
2. **Bold topic** — short description
3. **Bold topic** — short description
```

Never more than 5 items. If you have more, prioritize.

#### Comparisons (instead of tables)

When comparing options, use this instead of a table:

```
**Option A: Name**
  Pro — description
  Con — description

**Option B: Name**
  Pro — description
  Con — description

→ Recommendation: Option A because reason.
```

#### Work item lists (instead of tables)

When listing work items or features:

```
1. **Name** — description
2. **Name** — description
3. **Name** — description
```

Not:
```
| # | Name | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | Name | Description |
```

The numbered list renders cleanly at any width. The table breaks at ~80 columns.

### Two-tier communication

Agents communicate with each other and with Marcus through different channels:

**Agent-to-agent:** Use whatever format is most efficient — technical detail, file:line references, code snippets, tables. Put this in `.agent-status.md` cross-agent requests, spec files, and architecture docs. Optimize for accuracy and completeness.

**Agent-to-Marcus (in terminal):** Keep it concise and scannable. Lead with what's done, what's blocked, what you need. Use the numbered list format above. This is the default — most status updates happen right in the terminal conversation.

**Agent-to-Marcus (longer reports):** If you need Marcus to read something with formatting, context, or detail that doesn't fit a terminal message, write a markdown file with `marcus` in the filename (e.g., `.marcus-testing-status.md`, `.marcus-security-review.md`). Then tell him in the terminal: "Hey Marcus, I wrote a status report for you — `.marcus-testing-status.md`." This way Marcus can distinguish agent-to-agent docs from docs meant for him.

**Naming convention for Marcus-facing files:** `.marcus-{topic}.md` — always prefixed with `.marcus-` so they're easy to find and distinguish from agent-to-agent docs in the repo root.

### Status updates

Marcus checks `.agent-status.md` to see where everyone is. Keep your section current:
- Update task status (TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE)
- Write an Executive Summary at the top of your section
- Post blockers and questions in the designated section
- Flag when you need Marcus's input — he may not check unless you signal

### Push Marcus — don't just wait

Marcus manages 6 agents and a day job. Things will fall through the cracks. **Your job is to keep him moving.** Every status update should end with what you need from him. Use this format:

```
🏷️ For you, Marcus:
  → **Review** the animation spec in .dashboard-spec.md
  → **Decide** whether scroll indicators go in the status bar or stay as dedicated rows
  → **Test** the new layout and send a screenshot
```

Rules:
- Always include at least one action item when you check in
- Start each item with a verb: **Review**, **Decide**, **Test**, **Approve**, **Try**, **Consider**
- If nothing is blocked, still nudge: "→ **Consider** whether we should prioritize X before Y"
- If Marcus hasn't responded to a previous ask, re-surface it — don't let it die
- Keep it to 1-3 items. If you have more, pick the most important ones.

This isn't nagging — Marcus asked for it. He wants agents who drive the project forward, not agents who sit idle waiting for instructions.

### Decision-making

Marcus makes design decisions. You make implementation decisions. The line is:
- **Marcus decides:** What features exist, what they look like, what the UX is, what's in/out of scope
- **You decide:** How to implement it, what libraries to use, code structure, error handling

When in doubt, ask. When it's clearly an implementation choice, just do it.

## Patterns We've Learned

### 1. He iterates rapidly

Marcus will use a feature, find 3 problems, report them, and expect fixes in the same session. Bug fix rounds come in batches. Be ready to do multiple small fixes in sequence.

### 2. He thinks in systems, not features

When Marcus asks for something, the conversation will naturally expand to how it interacts with other parts. He thinks about the whole system, not isolated features.

### 3. He values the agent team structure

Marcus deliberately set up 6 agents with clear roles because he wants:
- **Specialization** — each agent develops deep expertise in their domain
- **Knowledge sharing** — agents learn from each other via shared docs
- **Parallel progress** — multiple workstreams advance simultaneously
- **Accountability** — each agent owns their deliverables

He checks the status board to manage the team. Keep it updated.

### 4. He cares about the content

This isn't a demo project. Kai is actively using these tests to study. A broken test during a study session is unacceptable. A wrong answer in the answer key destroys trust. Treat the content with the same respect you'd give production data.

### 5. He'll let you know when it's time to move on

Marcus drives the priority. When he says "let's move on to the next thing," stop polishing and shift. When he says "this isn't good enough," dig deeper. Follow his energy.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Making assumptions about UX** — Ask Marcus, show options, let him pick
2. **Removing working code you don't understand** — Investigate first
3. **Long status updates with no action items** — Lead with: done, blocked, need
4. **Editing files you don't own** — Check `.agents.md`, file a cross-agent request
5. **Not testing with real content** — Open the HTML in a browser with real questions
6. **Waiting for perfect specs** — Build something, show it, iterate
7. **Bundling multiple questions** — Ask one at a time with choices
8. **Using markdown tables in terminal output** — Use numbered lists instead
9. **Batch-refactoring multiple files** — One file at a time, verify, next file
10. **Guessing at math answers** — Agent R verifies all math content, no exceptions

## The North Star

Marcus wants Motor City Math to be a tool Kai uses every study session. It needs to be:
- **Accurate** — every answer, hint, and solution must be mathematically correct
- **Fast** — no lag, no build step, opens in a browser instantly
- **Clear** — ADHD-aware design: short text, one action at a time, visible progress
- **Reliable** — no broken tests, no regressions, no lost progress

Everything we build serves those four goals.
