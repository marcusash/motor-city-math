# Agent I — PDF Assessment Report

## Source Files

### 1. Winter Tri Standards Worksheets / Unit 2 Review
- **File:** `Copy of (Winter 11) Unit 2 Review.pdf`
- **Size:** 399 KB (text-based PDF)
- **Pages:** 10
- **Text extraction:** ✅ Full text extracted successfully via pdfjs-dist
- **Content:** Algebra 2 Unit 2 Review — Nonlinear Functions
- **Standards covered:**
  - W2: Identifying Characteristics of Nonlinear Functions (W2.a–W2.e)
  - W3: Solving Nonlinear Equations (W3.a–W3.e)
- **Question count:** ~26 problems
- **Question types:**
  - Parent function sketching (8 functions, page 2)
  - Transformation identification + graphing (Q1–Q6, pages 3–5)
  - Equation solving (Q7–Q12, page 6; Q17–Q22, page 8)
  - Graph-to-equation writing (Q13–Q16, page 7)
  - Capstone word problems (Q23–Q26, pages 9–10)
- **Import complexity:** Medium — structured text, but math notation needs LaTeX conversion
- **Priority:** HIGH — this is the immediate import target

### 2. Scanned Exponents Exam
- **File:** `2026011_Kai_exponents_Unit1.pdf`
- **Size:** 2.8 MB (image-based PDF)
- **Pages:** 4
- **Text extraction:** ❌ Zero text items — pure scanned images
- **Content:** Kai's completed exponents exam (likely handwritten answers on printed form)
- **Import complexity:** HIGH — requires OCR, possibly handwriting recognition
- **Priority:** LOW — defer to I-5. The exponents content already exists in 4 HTML tests.

## Recommendation
Start with the Unit 2 Review worksheet (I-2 through I-4). It has clean extractable text, covers standards not yet well-represented in the existing tests (nonlinear functions), and directly supports Feature #15 on the roadmap. The scanned exam (I-5) can wait — it's a harder problem and the content is partially duplicated.
