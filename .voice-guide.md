# Motor City Math — Voice Guide

**Purpose:** This is how Motor City Math talks to Kai. Every piece of feedback copy, error message, dashboard label, and encouragement line should sound like it came from Marcus — not a textbook, not a chatbot, not a generic ed-tech app.

**Source:** Derived from Marcus's communication patterns across 250+ interactions with the Inkwell agent team, his management style as a CVP of Design at Microsoft (leading 220 designers), and how he talks about Kai in 14 years of daily journal entries.

## Marcus's Voice — The Patterns

### 1. Direct, never vague

Marcus doesn't soften. He states the problem, then states what to do about it. No hedging.

**How he talks to agents:**
- "This needs work."
- "The copy on these pages doesn't feel connected."
- "Don't ever use MacOS as inspiration."
- "You can't be done yet."

**Motor City Math equivalent:**
- "3 wrong on exponents. Run them again."
- "Standard 3.c needs work. Here's where to start."
- "Not there yet. Keep going."

### 2. High standards, but with love underneath

Marcus pushes hard because he cares deeply. He called the Inkwell pitch deck presentation "not a side project README" — it's personal. He built 12 tests by hand for his son. That's love expressed through effort.

**How he talks about Kai (from journal patterns):**
- Pride in specific accomplishments
- Worry about focus and follow-through (ADHD context)
- Belief that Kai is capable of more than he shows
- Joy when the work pays off ("raised his grade to an A")

**Motor City Math equivalent:**
- "You got this. You've done harder problems."
- "88%. That's real progress. One more round and you'll own this unit."
- "Focus. 12 minutes left."

### 3. Short sentences, high energy

Marcus communicates in bursts. Voice-to-text style — flowing but punchy. He doesn't write paragraphs when a line will do. With Kai's ADHD, this is essential: every word must earn its place.

**Rules for Motor City Math copy:**
- Maximum 12 words per feedback line
- No compound sentences
- Emoji sparingly — one per message max
- Numbers are concrete: "4/5" not "almost all"

### 4. Coach, not teacher

Marcus isn't explaining algebra. He's coaching Kai through the work. The difference:

| Teacher says | Coach says |
|-------------|-----------|
| "You got 3 wrong on this section." | "3 wrong. Let's fix that." |
| "Review the inverse function material." | "Inverses. Run the drill again." |
| "Your score improved by 15%." | "Up 15%. That's momentum." |
| "Consider checking your work more carefully." | "Slow down. Check your signs." |

### 5. Celebrates results, not effort

Marcus respects output. "You raised your grade to an A" — that's the metric. He doesn't say "you tried really hard." He says "you did it."

**Motor City Math equivalent:**
- ✅ "100%. Clean sweep."
- ✅ "Up 20 points from last time."
- ✅ "Standard 3.a: mastered."
- ❌ "Good try!" (never)
- ❌ "You're doing your best!" (never)
- ❌ "Don't worry about the score." (never — the score matters)

## ADHD-Specific Guidelines

Kai has ADHD. These aren't just nice-to-haves — they're functional requirements.

1. **One thing at a time.** Never show two calls-to-action. "Check Answers" OR "Show Answer Key" — not both at once until answers are submitted.
2. **Visual hierarchy is focus management.** The question Kai is working on should be visually dominant. Everything else recedes.
3. **Progress is visible.** "Question 7 of 20" always shown. Kai needs to know where he is in the test.
4. **No walls of text.** Hints are one sentence. Solutions are numbered steps. Feedback is one line.
5. **Timer is motivating, not stressful.** Show time remaining, not time elapsed. Remaining time creates gentle urgency. Elapsed time creates anxiety.
6. **Celebrate completion, not just scores.** "Done. 20/20 answered." matters even if the score isn't perfect. Finishing is an achievement when focus is hard.
