**Reviewer:** Design Agent (from Inkwell project)
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Purpose:** Inventory the project, assess what's here, and inform the structure for a new agent team.

## What This Project Is

A collection of 12 hand-built HTML practice tests and quizzes for a 10th-grader studying Algebra II. Marcus built these with AI assistance to help his son Kai prepare for exams. **Result: Kai raised his grade to an A.** The tests are self-contained HTML files — no build system, no framework, no server. Open in a browser, work the problems, check your answers.

## Design Language

Consistent and intentional across all files:

- **Brand color:** `#8B1E3F` (deep burgundy/maroon) — used for headers, borders, buttons, accents
- **Typography:** Helvetica Neue / Arial, clean sans-serif
- **Layout:** Centered 1000px container, white card on light gray background
- **Question cards:** White with left border accent (`border-left: 4px solid #8B1E3F`), hover shadow
- **Buttons:** Burgundy fill (submit), burgundy outline (print), uppercase with letter-spacing
- **Print support:** Every file has `@media print` styles — hides buttons, adjusts layout for paper

This is a clean, focused design. The burgundy + white palette feels academic without being sterile. The question card pattern is consistent and scannable.

## Technical Architecture

**Stack:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS. No build tools. No dependencies except CDN libs.

**Libraries used:**
- **Chart.js** (7/12 files) — Scatter plots, line charts, function graphs
- **MathJax** (4/12 files) — LaTeX math rendering for complex equations

**Interactive features:**
| Feature | Files | How it works |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Answer key toggle | 12/12 | `showAnswerKey()` / `closeAnswerKey()` — overlay with full solutions |
| Print to PDF | 12/12 | `@media print` + `window.print()` |
| Save/load progress | 7/12 | `localStorage` — `saveResults()` / `loadResults()` per test |
| Auto-grading | 2/12 | `check()` function compares input to expected answers with tolerance |
| Interactive charts | 7/12 | Chart.js scatter/line plots embedded in questions |
| Resizable workspace | 1/12 | Drag-to-resize answer area (final_exam mini) |

**Patterns observed:**
- CSS is inline in every file (~200-300 lines duplicated per file, nearly identical)
- JS is inline in every file (answer key, save/load logic duplicated)
- No shared template or component system
- Questions are hardcoded HTML — no data model or question bank
- Answer validation in auto-grading files uses string comparison with numeric tolerance
- Standards-aligned: questions reference specific standards (e.g., "Standard 3.a: Function composition")

## Topics Covered

| Unit | Topics | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Unit 1** | Exponents, scientific notation, radicals, complex numbers | 4 exponent tests, exponents_exam |
| **Linear Functions** | Composition, sequences, graphing, inverses, regression, operations | index.html, index_calc.html, final exams |
| **Exponential Functions** | Growth/decay, linear vs exponential comparison | quiz_251120, quiz_251121 |
| **Non-Linear Functions** | Quadratics, absolute value, square root, piecewise, transformations | nonlinear_functions_test |
| **Inverse Functions** | Finding inverses, verifying, graphing | quiz_251117 |

## What's Working Well

1. **The result speaks:** A in Algebra II. The tests work as a study tool.
2. **Consistent visual design** — Every test feels like the same product. The burgundy accent, card layout, and typography are unified.
3. **Standards alignment** — Questions map to curriculum standards, making it clear what's being tested.
4. **Print-ready** — Every test works on paper. This matters for a student who might want to work problems by hand.
5. **Progressive difficulty** — The exponents unit has 3 attempts (same structure, presumably different focus) showing an iterative study approach.
6. **Chart.js integration** — Real, interactive graphs embedded in questions. Not screenshots — actual charts a student can hover over and inspect.

## Opportunities for Improvement

### 1. Eliminate duplication (biggest win)
~250 lines of CSS and ~100 lines of JS are copy-pasted across all 12 files. A shared `styles.css` and `scripts.js` would cut ~4,000 lines and make updates instant.

### 2. Extend auto-grading to all tests
Only 2/12 files have auto-grading. The others are answer-key-only (student self-checks). Adding grading to all tests would give immediate feedback — critical for solo studying.

### 3. Create a question bank / data model
Questions are hardcoded HTML. A JSON question bank would enable:
- Random test generation (new test every study session)
- Spaced repetition (re-test missed questions)
- Progress tracking across sessions
- Difficulty tagging

### 4. Add a test index / dashboard
No landing page linking all tests. A student has to know which file to open. A simple `dashboard.html` showing all tests, completion status, and scores would tie it together.

### 5. Math rendering consistency
4 files use MathJax, 8 don't. Some questions use plain text for equations (`x^2 + 3x - 4`) while others use LaTeX. Standardizing on MathJax or KaTeX everywhere would improve readability.

### 6. Mobile responsiveness
The layout is desktop-first (1000px container). Adding responsive breakpoints would let Kai study on his phone.

### 7. Naming convention
Files use mixed naming: `index.html`, `quiz_251117.html`, `20260119_Exponents_Unit1.html`. A consistent scheme like `unit1-exponents-v1.html` would be more navigable.

## Recommended Agent Team Structure

Based on how the Inkwell team worked, here's the same 6-agent model adapted for this project:

| Agent | Role | Owns | First Tasks |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| **Application (A)** | Build system, shared components, templating | `src/`, `styles/`, `scripts/`, build config | Extract shared CSS/JS, create question component template, build dashboard |
| **Research (R)** | Curriculum alignment, question quality, pedagogy | Question bank JSON, difficulty ratings, standard mappings | Audit all 200 questions for accuracy, tag by standard/difficulty/type, research spaced repetition |
| **Design (D)** | Visual design, UX, interaction patterns | Design system, dashboard layout, responsive specs | Formalize the burgundy design system, spec the dashboard, spec mobile breakpoints |
| **Fundamentals (F)** | Testing, validation, answer checking | Test suite, auto-grading logic, edge cases | Write answer validation tests, ensure grading tolerance is correct, test print layouts |
| **Security (S)** | Data integrity, progress tracking, privacy | localStorage schema, data export | Design progress tracking schema, ensure no student data leaks, offline-first audit |
| **Platform (P)** | Ops, CI/CD, agent coordination | Agent protocol, taskboards, docs | Set up agent protocol, define file ownership, establish review process |

### Key Differences from Inkwell

- **No encryption/privacy concern** — This is a study tool, not a journal. Security agent focuses on data integrity (don't lose saved progress) rather than encryption.
- **Research agent is critical** — Math accuracy is non-negotiable. Every question needs verification. The research agent should validate all answers and check alignment to Kai's actual curriculum.
- **Content is king** — The biggest value-add is more questions, better grading, and smarter study flow. The team should bias toward content (R) and interaction (A) over infrastructure (P/S).
- **Simpler stack** — Pure HTML/CSS/JS is a feature, not a limitation. Don't over-engineer. The goal is study tools that work, not a SaaS product.

## Summary

Marcus built 12 well-designed practice tests with ~200 questions covering 5 Algebra II units. The visual design is consistent and clean (burgundy `#8B1E3F` accent, card-based layout, print-ready). The tests use Chart.js for interactive graphs and MathJax for math rendering. The main opportunities are: extracting shared code (~4,000 duplicate lines), extending auto-grading to all tests, building a question bank for randomized practice, and adding a dashboard. The project is ready for an agent team to scale it systematically.

**The story:** A dad built study tools for his son. The son got an A. Now the dad wants to build a team to make the tools even better. That's a great starting point.
