## 🟢 FYI — Overall Project Status (from Agent P)

**Filed:** 2026-02-17 by Platform Agent

Marcus, here's where everything stands across the full team.

### The Big Picture

The foundation is built. Design specs are complete. The question bank exists. The test infrastructure is audited. What's missing is the builder — Agent A hasn't started yet, and Agent A owns all the implementation work that turns specs into working code. Agent S (Security) also hasn't started but is lower priority.

**26 bugs are open.** 22 are blockers. All are owned by Agent A. The most urgent: 5 files load a compromised CDN (polyfill.io), and `index.html` auto-grading is completely broken.

### Agent-by-Agent Status

| Agent | Role | Tasks Done | Status |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| **D (Design)** | Visual specs, UX, voice | **17/17** ✅ | Complete. All specs shipped. Nothing left. |
| **R (Research)** | Questions, math accuracy | **10/12** | 142 questions extracted + tagged. SRS designed. 2 tasks left (Winter Tri parse, new Qs). |
| **F (Fundamentals)** | Testing, QA | **9/12** | ~260 tests written. 3 tasks blocked on Agent A. |
| **P (Platform)** | Repo, docs, coordination | **8/8** ✅ | Complete. Repo structure, README, conventions all shipped. |
| **I (Importer)** | PDF → HTML pipeline | **5/7** | Unit 2 worksheet parsed → 26-question HTML test. OCR deferred. Needs R to verify answers. |
| **A (Application)** | Build everything | **0/14** ❌ | Not started. Owns all 26 open bugs + 14 backlog tasks. Critical path. |
| **S (Security)** | Data integrity, localStorage | **0/8** | Not started. Lower priority but has a localStorage collision bug waiting. |

### What's Been Delivered

**Specs (Agent D) — 12 component specs ready for implementation:**
`.dashboard-spec.md`, `.scorecard-spec.md`, `.hint-system-spec.md`, `.chart-spec.md`, `.streak-spec.md`, `.timer-spec.md`, `.question-type-spec.md`, `.responsive-spec.md`, `.print-spec.md`, `.arena-mode-spec.md`, `.accessibility-spec.md`, `.design-system.md`

**Data (Agent R):**
- `data/questions.json` — 142 questions, all tagged with unit/standard/difficulty/hints/solutions
- `data/standards.json` — 31 SAAS Algebra II standards with descriptions
- `docs/spaced-repetition-design.md` — Modified Leitner algorithm, ready to implement

**Shared code (Agent A started but not migrated):**
- `shared/styles.css` (13KB), `shared/scripts.js` (6KB), `shared/chart-theme.js`, `shared/print.css` — exist but no HTML files use them yet

**Testing (Agent F):**
- ~260 tests across 9 suites covering grading logic, print, localStorage, charts, mobile, cross-browser, offline
- Independently confirmed Agent R's math errors
- Found 2 additional bugs: localStorage key collision (B-F3), compromised polyfill.io CDN (B-F4)

**Import pipeline (Agent I):**
- `import/extract-pdf.mjs` + `import/parse-worksheet.mjs` — PDF → structured JSON → HTML
- `unit2_nonlinear_review.html` — 26-question test generated from teacher worksheet

**Infrastructure (Agent P):**
- Repo structure (`shared/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `docs/`)
- `README.md`, `.gitignore`, commit conventions, naming conventions, taskboard schedule

### Critical Path: What Needs to Happen Next

1. **🔴 Agent A needs to start.** Everything is waiting on A. The specs are written, the data exists, the tests are ready, the folder structure is in place. A owns:
   - Fix 22 blocker bugs (answer keys, broken grading, remove polyfill.io)
   - Migrate 12 HTML files to use `shared/` CSS/JS
   - Build auto-grading engine for all tests
   - Build the dashboard
   - Wire up the question bank renderer

2. **🔴 Remove polyfill.io immediately (B-F4).** This is a security issue. 5 files load from a CDN that was compromised in 2024. Surgical fix: delete the `<script>` tags. MathJax 3 doesn't need it.

3. **🟡 Agent S should start.** The localStorage collision bug (B-F3) needs the Security agent to design the schema properly. Agent F found 4 files overwriting each other's save data.

4. **🟡 Agent R needs to verify Importer output.** Agent I parsed 26 questions from the teacher worksheet but the answers haven't been verified. Math accuracy rule applies.

### Decisions For You

**🟡 DECISION: Agent A priority order**
Agent R recommended fixing answer keys before CSS extraction. Agent F says remove polyfill.io first (security). My recommendation for Agent A's first session:
1. Remove polyfill.io from 5 files (5 min, security blocker)
2. Fix the 6 wrong headline answers in `final_exam_251123.html` (surgical number replacements)
3. Fix Q6d and Q16b computation errors in `index_calc.html`
4. Then start A-1 (shared CSS extraction)

Does this priority order work for you, or do you want Agent A to focus elsewhere first?

## Prior Open Items

### 🟢 FYI — Agent R: Question bank and SRS design complete
**Filed:** 2026-02-17 by Research Agent

Marcus, the foundation is built:

- **`data/questions.json`** — 142 questions extracted from all 12 HTML files. Every question has: ID, unit, standard, difficulty, type, hint (≤12 words), and step-by-step solution. Known math errors are corrected in JSON.
- **`data/standards.json`** — Full SAAS Algebra II curriculum registry (6 units, 31 standards with descriptions, difficulty rubric).
- **`docs/spaced-repetition-design.md`** — Modified Leitner spaced repetition system. 6-box intervals (session → 1d → 3d → 7d → 14d), 15-question session cap for ADHD, localStorage data model, queue algorithm. Ready for Agent A to implement.

**What this enables:** Agent A can now build the question renderer (A-12), randomized practice mode (A-13), and test builder (A-14) using the structured question bank. The SRS algorithm is ready to power adaptive review sessions.

**Remaining R-agent work:** R-11 (parse Winter Tri worksheets), R-12 (generate 50 new questions per unit).

### 🔴 BLOCKER — Agent R: 21 math errors found in answer keys/grading
**Filed:** 2026-02-17 by Research Agent

Marcus, the math audit is complete. **8 of 12 files are clean.** But 4 files have significant errors:

**`index.html` — Grading is 100% broken.** The auto-grading JavaScript was copy-pasted from `index_calc.html` and doesn't match index.html's questions at all. Every auto-graded answer would be wrong, and the function crashes on Q11/Q14 (elements don't exist). The answer key MODAL is mostly correct — Kai likely used that, not auto-grading. **This is why he still got an A.**

**`final_exam_251123.html` — 6 wrong headline answers.** The work steps are correct but the bolded answer numbers are wrong (Q1: -234→210, Q5: -3→-9, Q6: sign error, Q7: 12/13→6/5, Q16b: off by one period, Q17b: computation error). If Kai reads the work, he gets the right answer. If he just reads the bold number, he learns the wrong thing.

**`index_calc.html` — 2 computation errors.** Q6d (62→66°F) and Q16b ($14,636.56→$14,616.18).

**Decision needed:** Should Agent A fix these now (before any other work), or should we prioritize the shared CSS/JS extraction first? My recommendation: fix the answer keys first — they're surgical changes (just number replacements) and directly affect Kai's learning.

Full bug list with correct answers is in `.agent-status.md` → Bugs section.
