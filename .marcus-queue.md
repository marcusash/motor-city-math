### 🟢 FYI — Agent R: Question bank and SRS design complete
**Filed:** 2026-02-17 by Research Agent

Marcus, the foundation is built:

- **`data/questions.json`** — 142 questions extracted from all 12 HTML files. Every question has: ID, unit, standard, difficulty, type, hint (≤12 words), and step-by-step solution. Known math errors are corrected in JSON.
- **`data/standards.json`** — Full SAAS Algebra II curriculum registry (6 units, 31 standards with descriptions, difficulty rubric).
- **`docs/spaced-repetition-design.md`** — Modified Leitner spaced repetition system. 6-box intervals (session → 1d → 3d → 7d → 14d), 15-question session cap for ADHD, localStorage data model, queue algorithm. Ready for Agent A to implement.

**What this enables:** Agent A can now build the question renderer (A-12), randomized practice mode (A-13), and test builder (A-14) using the structured question bank. The SRS algorithm is ready to power adaptive review sessions.

**Remaining R-agent work:** R-11 (parse Winter Tri worksheets), R-12 (generate 50 new questions per unit).

Marcus, the math audit is complete. **8 of 12 files are clean.** But 4 files have significant errors:

**`index.html` — Grading is 100% broken.** The auto-grading JavaScript was copy-pasted from `index_calc.html` and doesn't match index.html's questions at all. Every auto-graded answer would be wrong, and the function crashes on Q11/Q14 (elements don't exist). The answer key MODAL is mostly correct — Kai likely used that, not auto-grading. **This is why he still got an A.**

**`final_exam_251123.html` — 6 wrong headline answers.** The work steps are correct but the bolded answer numbers are wrong (Q1: -234→210, Q5: -3→-9, Q6: sign error, Q7: 12/13→6/5, Q16b: off by one period, Q17b: computation error). If Kai reads the work, he gets the right answer. If he just reads the bold number, he learns the wrong thing.

**`index_calc.html` — 2 computation errors.** Q6d (62→66°F) and Q16b ($14,636.56→$14,616.18).

**Decision needed:** Should Agent A fix these now (before any other work), or should we prioritize the shared CSS/JS extraction first? My recommendation: fix the answer keys first — they're surgical changes (just number replacements) and directly affect Kai's learning.

Full bug list with correct answers is in `.agent-status.md` → Bugs section.
