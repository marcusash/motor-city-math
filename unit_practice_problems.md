1. Simplify: \((3x^5y^{-2})(6x^{-3}y^4)\)

2. Simplify each expression (no negative exponents in the final answer):  
   a) \(\dfrac{(2a^{-4}b^3)^2}{4a^{-1}b^{-2}}\)  
   b) \(\dfrac{(5m^{-3}n^2)^2}{25m^{-1}n^{-4}}\)

5. Simplify: \(20\left(\dfrac{-3}{5x^4}\right)^3\)

6. Simplify: \(\left(\dfrac{3x^2}{2y^{-3}}\right)^{-2}\)

7. Solve for \(x\): \(2^{3x+1}=64\)

8. Solve for \(x\) and \(y\) (assume \(b>0\) and \(b\neq 1\)): \(\dfrac{b^{x}}{b^{y}}=b^{9}\) and \(\dfrac{b^{x+2}\cdot b^{3}}{b^{2y}}=b^{14}\)

9. Distribute and simplify (final answer with positive exponents): \(4x^2y\left(2xy^2-3y+\dfrac{1}{x}\right)\)
