# Agent A — Score Export/Import Assignment

## Your Assignment

Build the score export/import feature so Kai can send his test scores to me. The full implementation spec is in `.score-export-import-spec.md`. Read it top to bottom before writing any code.

You're also being evaluated. This is a training exercise — FA wrote a detailed spec and will review your work against it. The goal is to level you up to work independently. Take it seriously.

## What to Read First (in order)

1. `.agent-a-training.md` — your training document. Read the whole thing. It covers what went wrong on the Association sprint and the rules you must follow going forward.
2. `.score-export-import-spec.md` — the implementation spec. Has exact code, placement, merge logic, and a verification checklist.
3. This file — the workflow and review process below.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-flight (before writing any code)
- Read both target files (`index.html` lines 190-200, `parent.html` lines 180-190)
- Note the current line counts for both files
- Run `git status` — must be clean
- Post in `.agent-status.md`: "Starting score export/import. index.html is X lines, parent.html is Y lines."

### Step 2: Implement
- Follow the spec in `.score-export-import-spec.md`
- Make targeted edits only — do NOT rewrite either file
- If you deviate from the spec, document WHY in your self-review

### Step 3: Verify (every single box)
Complete the full verification checklist from the spec. This is not optional. Every checkbox. Both themes. Both files. Export, import, re-import, error cases.

### Step 4: Self-Review
Write up your self-review in `.agent-status.md` under your section. Include:
- Every file changed and why
- `git diff --stat` output
- New line counts for both files
- Anything you changed from the spec and why
- Anything you think FA might flag

### Step 5: Request FA Review
Post this EXACT block in `.agent-status.md`:

```markdown
### 🔍 Ready for FA Review — Score Export/Import
- Files changed: `index.html`, `parent.html`
- Commit: [hash]
- Spec followed: .score-export-import-spec.md
- Verification checklist: complete
- Self-review: posted below
- Both themes tested: ✅
```

**Then STOP.** Do not tell Marcus it's done. Do not push to personal remote. Do not move on to other tasks. Wait for FA to review.

## How You'll Be Evaluated

FA will grade your work on:

| Criteria | What FA checks |
|----------|----------------|
| **Spec compliance** | Did you follow the spec or deviate? Deviations documented? |
| **Verification** | Did you complete every checkbox? Did you actually test both themes? |
| **Self-review quality** | Did your self-review catch issues before FA did? |
| **Scope discipline** | Did `git diff --stat` show exactly 2 files? No surprise changes? |
| **Merge logic** | Does re-import not create duplicates? Does newer data win? |
| **Code quality** | try/catch on all localStorage reads? No hardcoded hex? Uses existing CSS classes? |

This is the first step in a graduated independence plan. Do well here and the review gate loosens. Do poorly and it tightens.

## Timeline

Start now. This should take one session. When you're done through Step 5, Marcus will loop in FA for the review.

Go.
