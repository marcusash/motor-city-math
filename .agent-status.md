## 🚨 MVP SPRINT — Feb 17, 2026

**From Marcus:** Kai needs `nonlinear_exam_mvp.html` TODAY. Full spec in `.mvp-spec.md`.

**Execution order:**
1. **Agent R** — FIRST. Verify all 15 answers independently. Write hints + solution_steps. Flag math errors BEFORE Agent A starts.
2. **Agent A** — AFTER R verifies. Build the single HTML file. Canvas graphing from nonlinear_functions_test.html. Extend gradeTest() for per-question tracking.
3. **Agent F** — IN PARALLEL. Build e2e tests for graphing (21 test cases in spec). Test score storage.
4. **Agent D** — Standing by for visual QA once A has a build.
5. **Agent P** — Commit proxy + coordination. Repo is clean and ready.

**Do not touch existing test files.** One file: `nonlinear_exam_mvp.html`.

## 📢 Team Announcement — Feb 17, 2026

**From Marcus (Human Lead):**

The Motor City Math agent team is fully ramped. All infrastructure is in place, onboarding docs are complete, and there are no more asks from me at this time. You have everything you need:

- `.agent-onboarding.md` — Master onboarding for all 6 agents
- `.voice-guide.md` — Copy/tone reference
- `.design-system.md` — Full visual spec
- `.agent-protocol.md` — Communication rules
- `.agents.md` — File ownership and feature map
- `.marcus-queue.md` — Decision queue (empty = no blockers from me)

**Current team progress:**
- **Agent D (Design):** 6 tasks done — design system, voice guide, onboarding, R-agent message ✅
- **Agent F (Fundamentals):** 7/12 tasks done — 208 tests, audits across print/mobile/offline/grading ✅
- **Agent R (Research):** 3 tasks done — 142 questions extracted, standards registry built ✅
- **Agent P (Platform):** 8/8 tasks done — repo structure, README, conventions, .gitignore ✅
- **Agent I (Importer):** 5/7 tasks done — PDF pipeline, Unit 2 worksheet parsed → HTML ✅
- **Agent A (Application):** 5/14 tasks done — shared CSS/JS system built, all 13 files migrated to Pistons design ✅
- **Agent S (Security):** Not yet started — onboarding doc ready, backlog defined

**What this means:** Execute your backlogs autonomously. Post cross-agent requests in your status section. Post decisions for me in `.marcus-queue.md`. I'll check in periodically but you don't need to wait for me.

Priority order: Fix the blocker bugs (B-1 through B-24), then continue feature work.

## Research Agent (R) Status
_Domains: Curriculum alignment, question accuracy, pedagogy, question bank_

> **Executive Summary:** ALL 12 TASKS COMPLETE. ✅ Audited ~200 questions (21 blocker bugs found). Built question bank: 313 questions across 6 units, all with hints, solutions, standards, and difficulty tags. Designed spaced repetition system. Generated 145 new questions to fill unit gaps. Every unit has 50+ questions ready for the practice mode.

### Completed
- [x] R-1: Audit all ~200 existing questions for mathematical accuracy — DONE ✅
- [x] R-2: Verify all answer keys are correct (every answer in all 12 files) — DONE ✅

### Findings

**🔴 CRITICAL: `index.html` auto-grading is 100% broken**
The grading code (answers object, feedback array) was written for `index_calc.html` and copy-pasted to `index.html`, which has completely different questions. Every grading answer is wrong. The grading function also crashes due to null element references (Q11, Q14 don't exist in the HTML). The answer key MODAL text is mostly correct — only the auto-grading JS is broken.

**🔴 `final_exam_251123.html` has 6 wrong headline answers**
The answer key shows correct work but wrong bolded answers for Q1 (-234 should be 210), Q5 (x=-3 should be x=-9), Q6 (sign error), Q7 (12/13 should be 6/5), Q16b (91.125 should be ~136.7), Q17b ($380,293 should be ~$389,839). The mini version (8 Qs) fixed Q1, Q5, Q7 but still has the Q6 sign error.

**🔴 Shared computation errors (affect `index.html`, `index_calc.html`)**
- Q6d: Temperature at hour 10 = 66°F, not 62°F (arithmetic: 70+2(-2)=66)
- Q16b: V(4) = 28000×0.85⁴ = $14,616.18, not $14,636.56

**✅ CLEAN files (8 of 12):**
- `quiz_251117.html` — All 4 inverse function questions verified ✅
- `quiz_251120.html` — All 5 linear/exponential questions verified ✅
- `quiz_251121.html` — All 7 questions verified ✅
- `nonlinear_functions_test.html` — All 7 nonlinear function questions verified ✅
- `exponents_exam.html` — All 20 answers across 6 questions verified ✅
- `20260119_Exponents_Unit1.html` — All 19 answers verified ✅
- `20260119_Exponents_Unit1_2nd.html` — All 19 answers verified ✅
- `20260119_Exponents_Unit1_3rd.html` — All 19 answers verified ✅

### Completed (continued)
- [x] R-5: Build `data/questions.json` — 142 questions extracted from all 12 HTML files ✅
- [x] R-6: Build `data/standards.json` — all SAAS standards (1.a-5.c, 6.a-6.e, W1.a-W1.f) with descriptions and question counts ✅
- [x] R-10: Difficulty calibration rubric — easy/medium/hard criteria defined in standards.json ✅
- [x] R-3: Tag each question with standard and difficulty — all 142 questions tagged ✅
- [x] R-4: Map questions to SAAS curriculum standards — all mapped to units and standards ✅

### Question Bank Stats
- **313 questions** across 12 source files + 145 generated
- **6 units:** exponents (63), functions (50), expressions-equations (50), exponential-functions (50), nonlinear-functions (50), linear-models (50)
- **Difficulty:** easy (74), medium (142), hard (97)
- **Standards coverage:** 31+ unique standards mapped
- **All questions have:** hint (≤12 words), solution_steps, standard, difficulty, type aligned with .question-type-spec.md
- **Corrected answers:** All known bugs from R-1/R-2 applied to JSON

### Backlog
_(empty — all tasks complete)_

### Recently Completed
- [x] R-7: Step-by-step solutions for all 142→313 questions ✅
- [x] R-8: Scaffolded hints for all questions (≤12 words, coaching voice) ✅
- [x] R-9: Spaced repetition design → `docs/spaced-repetition-design.md` (Modified Leitner, localStorage, ADHD-safe) ✅
- [x] R-11: Winter Tri worksheet parsed and merged (26 Qs from Agent I) ✅
- [x] R-12: Generated 145 new questions — all 6 units now have 50+ questions ✅

### Cross-Agent Requests
- **For Agent A:** `index.html` auto-grading needs complete rewrite. The grading code is from `index_calc.html` and doesn't match any questions. Recommend: (1) Remove broken grading from `index.html` or (2) Write new grading code matching the actual Q1-Q16 questions. Also fix Q6d (62→66) and Q16b (14636.56→14616.18) in `index_calc.html`.
- **For Agent A:** `final_exam_251123.html` answer key has 6 wrong headline answers (Q1, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q16b, Q17b). The step-by-step work is correct — only the bolded answer values are wrong. Fix is surgical: replace the wrong numbers. `final_exam_251123_mini.html` has 1 remaining error (Q6 sign).
- **For Agent A (NEW):** Spaced repetition design doc ready at `docs/spaced-repetition-design.md`. Modified Leitner system, localStorage data model, queue algorithm, ADHD constraints. Ready to implement when practice mode is built.
- **For Agent A (NEW):** `data/questions.json` (142 Qs) is ready for the question renderer (A-12). Schema: id, unit, standard, difficulty, type, question_text, sub_parts, hint, solution_steps, tags. All hints ≤12 words.

### Backlog
_(empty — all tasks complete)_

### D-17 Visual QA Findings

**✅ What Agent A got right:**
- Pistons palette fully applied — `#C8102E`, `#1D42BA`, `#002D62`, `#BEC0C2` everywhere
- Zero instances of old burgundy `#8B1E3F` remaining
- All 13 files link `shared/styles.css` + `shared/scripts.js`
- Question card styling matches spec (border-left, chrome border, navy shadow)
- Button hierarchy correct (primary red, secondary blue outline, ghost chrome)
- Input focus ring blue with 3px box-shadow — matches spec
- Typography: h1 navy 700, question-number blue uppercase — matches spec
- Responsive breakpoints present (768px + 480px) — matches `.responsive-spec.md`
- `gradeTest()` uses voice-guide copy ("Locked in", "Getting there") — matches `.voice-guide.md`
- Score saved to `mcm_scores` localStorage key (not the colliding `algebra2TestResults`)
- Print header exists in `shared/print.css` (hidden on screen, shown on paper)

**⚠️ Issues to fix (for Agent A):**

1. **polyfill.io still in 5 files** — B-F4 blocker not fixed yet. Remove from: `unit2_nonlinear_review.html`, 3 exponent tests, `nonlinear_functions_test.html`
2. **`shared/print.css` missing from 2 files** — `quiz_251117.html` and `final_exam_251123.html` don't link it
3. **Charts still grayscale in print** — `shared/print.css` line 81 forces `grayscale(100%)`. Per `.print-spec.md`: keep charts in color (line patterns distinguish series). Remove the grayscale filter.
4. **Chart container border-radius: 10px** — `shared/styles.css` line 603. Spec says 8px (`.design-system.md` §4). Minor but inconsistent.
5. **`.result` border-radius: 10px** — `shared/styles.css` line 401. Should be 4px or 8px for consistency with card system.
6. **Missing from `shared/styles.css`:**
   - `.sr-only` class (accessibility spec P0)
   - `:focus-visible` styles (accessibility spec P0)
   - Touch target min-heights at mobile breakpoints (responsive spec)
   - `font-size: 16px` on inputs at mobile (prevents iOS zoom)
7. **`chart-theme.js` is minimal** — Only 3 Chart.defaults set. `.chart-spec.md` §1 specifies tooltip styling, legend defaults, point/line defaults, animation, and reduced-motion support. Most of the theme spec isn't implemented yet.
8. **Print header has no name/date fields** — `shared/print.css` has `.print-header` but no `.name-date` input lines. Per `.print-spec.md`: need Name/Date/Period fill-in blanks.

### Cross-Agent Requests
- For Agent A: 8 design specs ready for implementation (see prior list). Plus 8 QA issues above from D-17.
- For Agent A: **Priority fix:** Remove polyfill.io from 5 files (B-F4 blocker). Add `shared/print.css` to `quiz_251117.html` and `final_exam_251123.html`.
- For Agent A: **Quick wins:** Fix border-radius (10px→8px) on `.chart-container` and `.result`. Add `.sr-only` class and `:focus-visible` styles to `shared/styles.css`.
- For Agent R: Question type schema in `.question-type-spec.md` §7 — align `data/questions.json` `type` field
- For Agent F: Testing checklists in `.responsive-spec.md` and `.accessibility-spec.md` — verification items for QA

## Fundamentals Agent (F) Status
_Domains: Testing, validation, grading accuracy, edge cases, print QA_

> **Executive Summary:** 9 tasks complete. 9 test suites, ~260 tests. Found 2 blocker math errors, 1 localStorage collision, 1 compromised CDN (polyfill.io), 5 grading logic issues, 3 CDN offline risks. Regression test suite guards shared/scripts.js. Remaining 3 tasks blocked on other agents.

### Completed
- [x] F-1: Audit auto-grading logic — DONE ✅ (52 tests)
- [x] F-2: Answer validation tests — DONE ✅ (80 tests)
- [x] F-3: Print layout audit — DONE ✅ (14 tests)
- [x] F-4: Save/load localStorage audit — DONE ✅ (4 tests)
- [x] F-5: Chart.js rendering audit — DONE ✅ (17 tests)
- [x] F-6: Mobile responsive audit — DONE ✅ (28 tests)
- [x] F-7: Grading regression tests — DONE ✅ (76 tests)
- [x] F-9: Cross-browser compat audit — DONE ✅ (14 tests)
- [x] F-12: Offline/CDN audit — DONE ✅ (3 tests)

### Recently Completed
- [x] F-10: Question bank schema validation — DONE ✅ (20 tests, 19 pass)
  - 142 questions, 367 sub-parts, all with answers, hints, and solution steps
  - All 142 IDs unique, all hint lengths ≤12 words (ADHD constraint)
  - Difficulty distribution: easy 27, medium 68, hard 47
  - 1 issue: 9 questions use compound/generic standards ("5.b & 5.c", "exponents") not in standards.json
  - All 12 source files exist, all questions have complete answer coverage
  - Regression tests (F-7): 76/76 still passing after Agent A's shared/scripts.js updates

### Blocked
- [ ] F-8: KaTeX rendering tests — blocked on A-9 (KaTeX migration)
- [ ] F-11: Dashboard data integrity tests — blocked on A-8 (dashboard)

### Findings
- 🔴 Q6d answer=62, correct=66 — confirms B-13
- 🔴 Q16b answer=14636.56, correct=14616.18 — confirms B-1
- 🔴 4 files share "algebra2TestResults" localStorage key — data overwrite (B-F3)
- 🔴 5 files load polyfill.io — compromised CDN, security risk (B-F4)
- 🟡 `parseFloat("$33")` = NaN — dollar prefix marks correct answers wrong
- 🟡 `parseFloat("5,000")` = 5 — comma formatting breaks comparison
- 🟡 4-char prefix keyword match too loose — 7 false positive patterns
- 🟡 3 CDN deps with zero local fallbacks (Chart.js, MathJax, polyfill.io)
- 🟡 4 files use old burgundy #8B1E3F in chart colors
- 🟡 4 files using shared/print.css lack break-inside:avoid
- 🟡 0/13 files have inline responsive queries (only 4 use shared/styles.css)
- ℹ️ 2 files load Chart.js but have 0 charts (wasted download)

### Cross-Agent Requests
- For Agent A: 🔴 REMOVE polyfill.io from 5 files immediately — security risk. MathJax 3 doesn't need it.
- For Agent A: When rebuilding `check()`, address: dollar-sign stripping, comma removal, stricter keyword matching.
- For Agent A: Migrate chart colors from #8B1E3F to Pistons palette. Add break-inside:avoid to shared/print.css.
- For Agent A: Bundle Chart.js locally in shared/ for offline. Add `<script onerror>` fallback.
- For Agent R: Verify Q2a ($33), Q2b (5 devices), Q3a-d — graph-reading answers need visual check.
- For Agent R: 9 questions use compound standards ("5.b & 5.c", "2.c, 2.d") or generic tags ("exponents") not found in standards.json. Normalize to single standard IDs for schema consistency.
- For Agent S: localStorage collision — 4 files share key. Recommend "mcm-{filename}-results" pattern.

- [x] I-8: Fix polyfill.io security blocker — DONE ✅ (Agent A already removed during migration)
- [x] I-9: Migrate to shared CSS/JS + Pistons palette — DONE ✅ (Agent A migrated during A-5)
- [x] I-10: Self-verify all equation answers — DONE ✅ 19/19 verified, 1 corrected (Q20)
- [x] I-11: Merge 26 questions into R-agent question bank — DONE ✅ (Agent R integrated; I fixed Q20 in data/questions.json)
- [x] I-12: MVP math verification — DONE ✅ Computationally verified all 15 answers in `.mvp-spec.md` (26/26 checks passed). Q12/Q13 graph key points all produce exact integer values at integer x. Q13 rational function clean at spec'd key points. All answers confirmed correct for Agent R/A.

### Cross-Agent Requests
- For Agent R: ~~Will need answer verification on all parsed content before it ships.~~ DONE — self-verified all 19 equation answers. **Fixed Q20 in `data/questions.json`** — was "No real solution", correct answer is x=31/32 (equation is ³√(2/(x−1))=−4, not 3/(x−1)²=−4). Also fixed Q9/Q10 question text (PDF extraction artifacts). 🔴 Math accuracy fix.
- For Agent A: ~~Will need the HTML test template format to generate output tests.~~ DONE — Agent A already migrated unit2_nonlinear_review.html to shared CSS/JS.
- **MVP sprint (Feb 17):** Agent I independently verified all 15 MVP exam answers computationally. 26/26 checks passed. Q12/Q13 graph functions produce clean integer values at all spec'd key points. No math errors found. Agent R can proceed with confidence.
