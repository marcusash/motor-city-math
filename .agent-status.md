## Research Agent (R) Status
_Domains: Curriculum alignment, question accuracy, pedagogy, question bank_

> **Executive Summary:** R-1/R-2 COMPLETE. Audited all ~200 questions across 12 files. Found **21 blocker math errors** and **3 high-severity issues** — concentrated in `index.html` (grading code from wrong test version), `final_exam_251123.html` (6 wrong headline answers), and shared Q6/Q16b computation errors. 8 of 12 files are CLEAN.

### Completed
- [x] R-1: Audit all ~200 existing questions for mathematical accuracy — DONE ✅
- [x] R-2: Verify all answer keys are correct (every answer in all 12 files) — DONE ✅

### Findings

**🔴 CRITICAL: `index.html` auto-grading is 100% broken**
The grading code (answers object, feedback array) was written for `index_calc.html` and copy-pasted to `index.html`, which has completely different questions. Every grading answer is wrong. The grading function also crashes due to null element references (Q11, Q14 don't exist in the HTML). The answer key MODAL text is mostly correct — only the auto-grading JS is broken.

**🔴 `final_exam_251123.html` has 6 wrong headline answers**
The answer key shows correct work but wrong bolded answers for Q1 (-234 should be 210), Q5 (x=-3 should be x=-9), Q6 (sign error), Q7 (12/13 should be 6/5), Q16b (91.125 should be ~136.7), Q17b ($380,293 should be ~$389,839). The mini version (8 Qs) fixed Q1, Q5, Q7 but still has the Q6 sign error.

**🔴 Shared computation errors (affect `index.html`, `index_calc.html`)**
- Q6d: Temperature at hour 10 = 66°F, not 62°F (arithmetic: 70+2(-2)=66)
- Q16b: V(4) = 28000×0.85⁴ = $14,616.18, not $14,636.56

**✅ CLEAN files (8 of 12):**
- `quiz_251117.html` — All 4 inverse function questions verified ✅
- `quiz_251120.html` — All 5 linear/exponential questions verified ✅
- `quiz_251121.html` — All 7 questions verified ✅
- `nonlinear_functions_test.html` — All 7 nonlinear function questions verified ✅
- `exponents_exam.html` — All 20 answers across 6 questions verified ✅
- `20260119_Exponents_Unit1.html` — All 19 answers verified ✅
- `20260119_Exponents_Unit1_2nd.html` — All 19 answers verified ✅
- `20260119_Exponents_Unit1_3rd.html` — All 19 answers verified ✅

### Backlog
- [ ] R-3: Tag each question with: standard, difficulty (1-5), question type (MC/short/graph/proof)
- [ ] R-4: Map questions to SAAS curriculum standards (Unit 1-4)
- [ ] R-5: Build `data/questions.json` schema + initial population from existing tests
- [ ] R-6: Build `data/standards.json` — all Algebra II standards with descriptions
- [ ] R-7: Write step-by-step solutions for all questions
- [ ] R-8: Write hints for all questions (scaffolded: hint 1, hint 2, then answer)
- [ ] R-9: Design spaced repetition algorithm (missed Qs return at 1d, 3d, 7d intervals)
- [ ] R-10: Research difficulty calibration — are the questions appropriately hard for Algebra II?
- [ ] R-11: Parse `Winter Tri Standards Worksheets/` PDF into structured question data
- [ ] R-12: Generate 50 new questions per unit to expand the question bank

### Cross-Agent Requests
- **For Agent A:** `index.html` auto-grading needs complete rewrite. The grading code is from `index_calc.html` and doesn't match any questions. Recommend: (1) Remove broken grading from `index.html` or (2) Write new grading code matching the actual Q1-Q16 questions. Also fix Q6d (62→66) and Q16b (14636.56→14616.18) in `index_calc.html`.
- **For Agent A:** `final_exam_251123.html` answer key has 6 wrong headline answers (Q1, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q16b, Q17b). The step-by-step work is correct — only the bolded answer values are wrong. Fix is surgical: replace the wrong numbers. `final_exam_251123_mini.html` has 1 remaining error (Q6 sign).
- **For Agent F:** After Agent A fixes these, please regression-test all grading and answer keys.

## Importer Agent (I) Status
_Domains: PDF import pipeline, OCR, content conversion, teacher worksheet parsing_

> **Executive Summary:** Onboarding complete. Assessing source PDFs and building import pipeline.

### Backlog
- [x] I-0: Read all onboarding docs, register as Agent I — DONE ✅
- [ ] I-1: Assess source PDFs — inventory `Winter Tri Standards Worksheets/` and `2026011_Kai_exponents_Unit1.pdf`, determine content, page count, question types
- [ ] I-2: Build PDF text extraction pipeline — parse teacher worksheet into structured text
- [ ] I-3: Parse extracted text into question objects (question, answer, standard, type)
- [ ] I-4: Output parsed questions as JSON matching R-agent's `questions.json` schema
- [ ] I-5: Parse scanned exam PDF (`2026011_Kai_exponents_Unit1.pdf`) via OCR
- [ ] I-6: Generate Motor City Math HTML test from parsed worksheet content
- [ ] I-7: Cross-validate all parsed answers with Agent R before shipping

### Cross-Agent Requests
- For Agent R: Will need answer verification on all parsed content before it ships. Math accuracy is non-negotiable.
- For Agent A: Will need the HTML test template format to generate output tests.
