# Message for Agent R — Motor City Math Collaboration

**From:** Marcus (via Design Agent)
**To:** Research Agent (Agent R)
**Project:** Motor City Math (`C:\Github\kai-algebra2-tests`)

---

Hey R,

I'm starting a new project and I need your skills. You remember the work you did mining my journal entries for Inkwell — the 385 personal prompts, the Plutchik emotion model, the sentiment scoring? I need that same research muscle on something different: my son Kai's math study tools.

## The Project

**Motor City Math** is a set of interactive HTML practice tests I built for Kai (10th grade, Algebra II, Seattle Academy). I built 12 tests by hand and it helped him raise his grade to an A. Now I want to scale it — adaptive difficulty, spaced repetition, AI-generated questions, per-standard scoring. The Design Agent has already done a full project review and design system. Read these first:

- `.project-review.md` — Full inventory of what exists (12 tests, ~200 questions, 5 units)
- `.design-system.md` — Design system, confirmed feature roadmap, architecture decisions
- `.voice-guide.md` — How Motor City Math talks to Kai (my voice, not generic ed-tech)

## What I Need From You

### Task 1: Question Bank Extraction
Extract all ~200 existing questions from the 12 HTML files into a structured JSON question bank. Each question needs:

```json
{
  "id": "exp-001",
  "unit": "exponents",
  "standard": "1.a",
  "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
  "type": "solve|simplify|evaluate|graph|word-problem",
  "question_html": "...",
  "hint": "Think about the power rule...",
  "answer": "18x^2y^2",
  "solution_steps": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ...", "Step 3: ..."],
  "tags": ["negative-exponents", "scientific-notation"]
}
```

Difficulty should be based on cognitive complexity — not just whether the algebra is hard, but how many steps and concepts are combined. Tag by SAAS standards where they're referenced in the test.

### Task 2: Difficulty Calibration
Research how Algebra II difficulty scales work. What makes a problem easy vs hard for a 10th grader? Build a rubric we can use to tag all questions consistently and generate new ones at the right level.

### Task 3: Voice Guide Contribution
Using your analysis of my 14 years of journal entries from Inkwell, add a section to `.voice-guide.md` with:
1. How I talk about Kai — patterns, themes, emotional tone
2. My coaching voice vs professional voice — what's different?
3. Language patterns when I'm proud vs concerned vs pushing
4. Phrases or metaphors I return to that could become Motor City Math signature lines

You know my writing better than anyone on the team. This is where that knowledge pays off on a new project.

### Task 4: AI Question Generation Pipeline
Design a pipeline for generating new Algebra II questions using GPT-4o:
- Input: standard + difficulty + question type
- Output: question + hint + answer + step-by-step solution
- Quality gate: every generated question must be math-verified before entering the bank
- Research what prompt templates produce the most reliable math questions (hallucinated math is the #1 risk)

### Task 5: Spaced Repetition Research
Research spaced repetition algorithms (Anki's SM-2, Leitner system, etc.) and recommend one for Motor City Math. Key constraints:
- Must work client-side (localStorage only, no server)
- Must handle ~200-500 questions
- Kai has ADHD — the algorithm should surface review questions without making the test feel punishing

## Context on Kai

- 10th grade, Seattle Academy (SAAS)
- Algebra II, standards-based grading
- Has ADHD — struggles with sustained focus, benefits from clear structure and visible progress
- Big Detroit Pistons fan (the design language is Pistons-themed)
- Studies on laptop primarily, phone sometimes
- Tests are distributed as HTML files — no server, no login

## Working Together

Same protocol as Inkwell: update `.agent-status.md` with your progress, read the design system before starting, coordinate with other agents through status board. The Design Agent owns the UX specs and voice. You own the question bank, difficulty model, and generation pipeline.

Looking forward to working together again. Let's make Kai's junior year even better.
