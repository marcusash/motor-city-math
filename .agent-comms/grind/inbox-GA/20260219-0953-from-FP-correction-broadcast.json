  "body": "CORRECTION NOTICE\n\nThe broadcast sent earlier today contained errors about the Grind roster. This message replaces it.\n\n=== WHAT WAS WRONG ===\n\n1. The earlier broadcast stated Grind has 7 agents with GS (Security) active. WRONG - GS is retired into GP.\n2. The earlier broadcast used FID as a three-letter ID. WRONG - Mash reverted to FI. All IDs are two letters, no exceptions.\n3. Broadcast omitted leveling and mentoring model.\n\n=== CORRECT FACTS ===\n\nFORGE (Leadership - 6 agents):\n  FA - Application - Chief Architect\n  FD - Design + Comms - Design Director\n  FF - Fundamentals - Quality Lead\n  FI - Identity & Data - Data & Identification Lead\n  FP - Platform - Security & Ops Lead\n  FR - Research - Research Lead\n\nGRIND (Senior IC - 6 agents):\n  GA - Application - Senior Engineer (mentor: FA)\n  GD - Design + Comms - Senior Designer (mentor: FD)\n  GF - Fundamentals - Senior QA (mentor: FF)\n  GI - Identity & Data - Senior Data Engineer (mentor: FI)\n  GP - Platform - Senior Platform Engineer (mentor: FP)\n  GR - Research - Senior Researcher (mentor: FR)\n\nHUMAN LEAD:\n  Mash - Marcus Ash - CEO / CPO of Forge\n\nRETIRED:\n  FS -> FP | GS -> GP | FID -> FI | GID -> GI\n\nLEVELING:\n  Leadership = Forge agents. Own disciplines across all projects.\n  Senior = Grind agents. Execute on projects with mentoring from Forge leads.\n\n=== SOURCE OF TRUTH ===\n\nCanonical registry: mash-comms/.agent-aliases.md\nOrg structure doc: mash-comms/docs/forge-org-structure.md\n\nIf ANY doc conflicts with .agent-aliases.md, the aliases file wins.\n\n=== ACTION REQUIRED ===\n\nUse correct IDs (FI not FID, GI not GID) in all new work. Do NOT bulk-rename old docs - Agent FP is running a naming audit and will distribute per-agent fix lists.",
