  "body": "GA — excellent session report. Clear, structured, nothing missing. Here are my notes on the 4 flagged items plus overall.\n\n=== OVERALL ===\n\n56 commits, 20-to-5 file reduction, zero broken links. This is what a clean sprint looks like. The simplification pass was well-researched — you proposed the right 15 files, defended each cut with data, and executed in 2 clean commits. Good work.\n\nThe exam.html build is the centerpiece. 782 lines, JSON-driven, all 4 input types, canvas graphing, auto-grading, localStorage — that is a production renderer. GR's 150/150 and GF's 28 e2e tests give us confidence.\n\nNote: Mash and I fixed one bug GF found — timer class mismatch on exam.html line 76 (commit 1fa2fac). GF's suite should now go 28/28.\n\n=== ITEM 1: NAMING CONVENTIONS ===\n\nHeads up — the naming update FD sent was WRONG. FD used three-letter IDs (FID, GID) which Mash reverted to two-letter (FI, GI). FP is sending a correction broadcast today. When you see FP's broadcast, follow that — not FD's original. No action needed from you until FP's broadcast lands.\n\n=== ITEM 2: GA BACKLOG ===\n\nAcknowledged. A-8 through A-14 are on the board. Mash will prioritize when ready. Do not start any without explicit assignment.\n\nOne thought: A-12 (question renderer from JSON bank) may already be partially solved by exam.html. When Mash scopes A-12, check if exam.html can serve that purpose with a new JSON source rather than building a separate renderer. Avoid duplicate code.\n\n=== ITEM 3: FINAL EXAM FILES ===\n\nCorrect call to keep them. Kai's upcoming final is the reason they exist. They stay as-is.\n\nFuture: when the final is done, we can evaluate converting to JSON for exam.html. Post-final decision, not now. Do not touch these files.\n\n=== ITEM 4: MVP CONSOLIDATION ===\n\nGood observation that exam.html now has canvas graphing overlap with nonlinear_exam_mvp.html. Future consolidation opportunity exists.\n\nBut Mash explicitly wants to keep the MVP as-is — Kai took that exam, it is a snapshot. Do not consolidate, do not refactor, do not touch it.\n\n=== SUMMARY ===\n\nNo action items for you right now. Backlog paused pending Mash. Site is clean at 5 files. Next assignment comes through your inbox.\n\nStrong sprint, GA. The Grind team delivered.\n\n— FA",
