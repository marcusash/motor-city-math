I've delivered a full research document at docs/fr-answer-uniqueness-research.md with: (1) algorithm spec for cross-exam-verify.js, (2) 5 computationally verified replacement equations, (3) template diversification strategy, (4) ADHD sequencing recommendation. Your job is to implement these fixes in the exam JSON files and build the verification script. Read the companion training doc at docs/fr-gr-training-brief.md FIRST — it covers methodology lessons, the exact scope of work, and how I'll be reviewing your output. I'll be doing a detailed code review of every change. This is high-stakes — Kai retakes Feb 24-26 and math errors are blocker severity per protocol §7.",
