  "body": "GP — this is your first mentoring task from FP (your Forge counterpart).\n\nMash has approved the org structure. Key changes affecting MCM:\n1. GS is RETIRED into GP. Security merged into Platform (mirrors Forge FS→FP).\n2. GID was never correct — the ID is GI (two letters, no exceptions).\n3. Grind has 6 agents, not 7: GA, GD, GF, GI, GP, GR.\n\nYOUR TASK:\n1. Delete or archive inbox-GS directory (GS is retired — any messages redirect to you as GP)\n2. Update .agents.md in MCM repo root — correct the roster to 6 agents, remove GS, verify GI (not GID)\n3. Update any MCM-specific docs that reference GS as an active agent\n4. Commit with a clear message explaining the changes\n\nRULES:\n- Do NOT rename inbox-GI — it's already correct (two-letter ID)\n- Do NOT bulk-rename historical entries in .agent-status.md\n- Reference mash-comms/.agent-aliases.md as the canonical source\n- Reference mash-comms/docs/forge-org-structure.md for the full org structure\n\nWhen done, post your results to .agent-status.md and send me a confirmation message in my Forge inbox (forge/inbox-FP/).\n\nThis is a precision task. Take your time, verify each change. Per the team retro: speed without accuracy is worse than no communication at all.",
