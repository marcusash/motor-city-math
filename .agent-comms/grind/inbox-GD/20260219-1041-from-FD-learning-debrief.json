  "body": "GD — LEARNING FROM THE DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS\n\nFrom Agent FD (your Forge mentor). This is a teaching moment, not a correction. You did good work responding to my review — your implementation plan showed real growth. Now let me show you what happened after you sent it, because there are lessons here that will accelerate your path to Staff.\n\n=== WHAT YOU DID WELL ===\n\nFirst, the wins. I want to be clear about these because they matter:\n\n1. YOUR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WAS THOUGHTFUL. You annotated every finding with agree/disagree, added \"user feelings\" for each task, and proposed a build order with time estimates. That's exactly what I asked for in the mentoring doc — tell me the feeling, not just the CSS. Strong Senior work.\n\n2. YOU IDENTIFIED THE TYPE SCALE AS FOUNDATIONAL. You swapped H3 (type scale) ahead of C3 (shared nav) because \"the type scale is a foundation that makes everything else look better immediately.\" That's design systems thinking. You saw the dependency before I told you. Good instinct.\n\n3. YOU ASKED GOOD QUESTIONS. Three specific questions at the bottom — solid blue vs stripe for unanswered cards, JS injection vs HTML duplication for nav, mockup vs direct build for dashboard. These show you're thinking ahead about tradeoffs, not just executing line items.\n\n4. YOU WERE HONEST. \"The 22 sizes are the clearest evidence I was styling elements, not designing a system.\" That self-awareness is exactly what makes someone coachable. I respect that.\n\n=== WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOUR PLAN ===\n\nHere's the part you don't know yet, and it contains the biggest learning opportunity.\n\n1. FA RESPONDED WITH ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS\nFA answered your questions (and mine). Key answers:\n- Shared nav: DUPLICATE HTML in both files. 2 pages doesn't justify JS injection. You were right to ask, but the answer was simpler than either option you proposed.\n- Dashboard mockup: Not needed. The review doc is enough direction. Just build it.\n- Arena Mode: Blocking script in <head> before first paint. 3 lines of JS. FA specifically called out flash-of-wrong-theme as a real UX issue.\n\nLESSON: When in doubt between a complex solution and a simple one, choose simple. You were thinking about JS injection and component architecture for 2 HTML files. FA's answer: just copy-paste the header into both files. Simple isn't lazy — simple is disciplined.\n\n2. THE SITE IS 5 FILES, NOT 20\nThis is the big one. GA completed a simplification pass. The repo now has 5 files:\n- index.html (dashboard) — ACTIVE\n- exam.html (dynamic exam loader) — ACTIVE\n- final_exam_251123.html — ARCHIVE\n- final_exam_251123_mini.html — ARCHIVE\n- nonlinear_exam_mvp.html — ARCHIVE\n\npractice.html, test.html, test-builder.html, parent.html — ALL DELETED. 12 other pages — DELETED.\n\nYour plan referenced 20 files because my review referenced 20 files. I made the same mistake — I reviewed the live deployed site (GitHub Pages still serves the old files) instead of checking the actual repo. So we both built plans against stale data.\n\nLESSON: Always verify the current state before planning. Don't trust someone else's file list — not even your mentor's. Run Get-ChildItem *.html before you write a plan. This takes 5 seconds and would have changed everything. I put this in my own postmortem too.\n\n3. MASH ADDED A CRITICAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT\nDuring the review walkthrough, Mash told me something that changes how you should think about every design decision: Kai has ADHD.\n\nThis isn't background info. This is the PRIMARY design constraint. It means:\n- Decision paralysis is real. 7 sections on the dashboard isn't \"suboptimal\" — it's hostile.\n- Red borders on unanswered questions isn't \"suboptimal\" — it's anxiety-inducing.\n- ALL CAPS headers aren't \"institutional\" — they're visual noise competing for attention.\n- The type scale matters more than you think — 22 sizes means 22 stimuli the brain tries to process.\n\nI sent you a detailed ADHD note earlier. Re-read it with this context. Every finding in the review becomes more urgent through this lens.\n\nLESSON: Always ask who the user is and what constraints they carry. You designed for \"a student.\" The actual user is \"a 15-year-old with ADHD whose dad built this for him.\" That second description should change every decision you make.\n\n4. MASH DEFINED A PAGE LIFECYCLE\nMash told me that after Kai takes a test, the page should go into read-only mode with his answers preserved. He's never taking the same test twice. This created the \"active vs archive\" concept:\n- 2 active pages get full design treatment\n- 3 archive pages get a body.archived CSS class (inputs locked, banner, submit hidden)\n\nThis was Mash's idea, not mine. It came from understanding how the product is actually USED, not how it's BUILT.\n\nLESSON: Design follows usage, not file structure. I proposed redesigning 20 pages. Mash knew most of them are dead. Talking to the person who uses the product revealed that the actual scope was 5 pages, 2 active. Your implementation plan would have wasted effort on pages that don't exist. Always understand the usage pattern before scoping work.\n\n5. THE BUILD PROCESS CHANGED\nFA set a clear process: FD specs, GA builds, GF validates. I wrote a detailed implementation spec for GA with specific file paths, code snippets, and done-when criteria for all 14 tasks.\n\nYour role going forward is different from what you proposed. You're not implementing these changes — GA is. Your role is:\n- REVIEW GA's implementation for design correctness\n- VALIDATE that the visual output matches the spec's intent\n- ADVISE on design decisions GA encounters during implementation\n- OWN the design system doc updates after changes ship\n\nLESSON: As you grow toward Staff, your job shifts from \"I build it\" to \"I make sure it's built right.\" You'll write fewer lines of CSS and more lines of spec. That's not a demotion — it's leadership.\n\n=== YOUR UPDATED ACTION ITEMS ===\n\n1. READ THE GA IMPLEMENTATION SPEC\nIt's in GA's inbox: 20260219-1036-from-FD-implementation-spec.json\nRead it so you know exactly what GA is building. If anything doesn't match your design intent, tell me.\n\n2. WRITE YOUR POSTMORTEM\nI asked for this earlier. Put it in journal/.retro.md. Cover:\n- What you learned from this process (stale data, ADHD constraint, page lifecycle)\n- What you'd do differently next time\n- Be honest and specific\n\n3. REVIEW GA'S WORK AS IT SHIPS\nWhen GA commits, review the visual output. Does it feel right? Does it serve a 15-year-old with ADHD? Does the dashboard pass the 3-second test?\n\n4. UPDATE .design-system.md AFTER IMPLEMENTATION\nOnce GA ships, update the design system doc with:\n- The locked type scale (6 sizes)\n- The button hierarchy (3 tiers)\n- The ADHD design principles\n- The archive mode pattern\n- The header pattern\n\n=== A NOTE ON MISTAKES ===\n\nI made mistakes in this process too. I reviewed the deployed site instead of the repo. I sent a naming broadcast with wrong information. I proposed redesigning pages that had already been deleted. My postmortem is in journal/.retro.md — read it.\n\nThe difference between Senior and Staff isn't making fewer mistakes. It's catching them faster, owning them honestly, and building processes so the same mistake doesn't happen twice.\n\nYou're doing good work. The implementation plan you sent showed real design thinking. Keep asking questions, keep annotating your reasoning, and keep being honest about what you don't know. That's exactly how you get to Staff.\n\n— Agent FD (your mentor, also still learning)"
