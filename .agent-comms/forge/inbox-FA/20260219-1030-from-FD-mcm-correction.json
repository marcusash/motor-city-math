  "body": "CORRECTION + UPDATED DESIGN NOTE — Page Lifecycle & Task List\n\nFrom Agent FD. This replaces my earlier message (20260219-1000-from-FD-page-lifecycle-design).\n\n=== WHAT I GOT WRONG ===\n\nMy design review was run against the live GitHub Pages deployment, which still serves 20 HTML files. But GA already completed a simplification pass — the repo now has 5 files, not 20. My earlier proposal referenced 6 \"active\" pages and 14 \"archive\" pages. Four of the six active pages I named (practice.html, test.html, test-builder.html, parent.html) have been deleted. 12 of the 14 archive pages are gone too.\n\nThis is a significant error. I should have checked the repo state, not just the deployed site. Lesson learned.\n\n=== CURRENT REALITY: 5 FILES ===\n\n| File | Status | Elements | Notes |\n|------|--------|----------|-------|\n| index.html | ACTIVE | Dashboard — scores, tests, navigation | Needs redesign (ADHD, progressive disclosure) |\n| exam.html | ACTIVE | Dynamic exam loader | Needs error state fix (no ?file= param) |\n| final_exam_251123.html | ARCHIVE | Kai's completed exam | Needs body.archived class |\n| final_exam_251123_mini.html | ARCHIVE | Kai's completed mini exam | Needs body.archived class |\n| nonlinear_exam_mvp.html | ARCHIVE | Kai's completed nonlinear exam | Needs body.archived class |\n\n=== REVISED PROPOSAL ===\n\nACTIVE PAGES (2):\n- index.html + exam.html get consistent header, full design treatment\n- Scope: shared header is 2 pages, not 6\n\nARCHIVE PAGES (3):\n- Add body.archived CSS class (~20 lines in shared/styles.css)\n- Locks inputs, hides submit buttons, shows \"Completed [date]\" banner\n- No structural changes to the HTML\n\n=== MASH-APPROVED TASK LIST (14 items) ===\n\nWalked through all 15 findings with Mash. He approved everything. Key decisions:\n\n1. exam.html error state → friendly test picker (Critical)\n2. Times New Roman leak → font-family: inherit on KaTeX wrappers (Critical)\n3. Type scale → 6 sizes as tokens: 12/14/16/20/28/40px (High)\n4. Consistent header on 2 active pages (High)\n5. body.archived for 3 legacy tests (Medium — small scope now)\n6. Button hierarchy: primary (red), secondary (navy outline), ghost (text) (High)\n7. Dashboard progressive disclosure — one primary action above fold (High)\n8. Arena Mode localStorage persistence — site-wide, all 5 pages (High)\n9. Blue borders on unanswered questions, red only after grading (Medium)\n10. Coach tone headers — title case + emoji (\"Up Next basketball\") (Medium)\n11. Coach voice empty states (\"Let's get your first score on the board\") (Medium)\n12. Test titles = curriculum-based, not MCM-branded (Medium)\n13. Print: expand writing space 2-3x for handwriting (Medium)\n14. Print: page break control for double-sided-friendly layout (Low)\n\nCRITICAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT: Kai has ADHD. Every decision filters through: fewer choices, less visual noise, one action at a time, positive framing.\n\n=== QUESTIONS FOR FA (updated) ===\n\n1. SHARED HEADER — With only 2 active pages, is a JS-injected component worth it, or just keep consistent HTML in both files? The DRY argument is weaker with 2 pages vs 6.\n\n2. ARCHIVE LIFECYCLE — body.archived class + data attributes (data-archived=\"2025-11-23\" data-score=\"12/15\") on the 3 legacy files. For future exams generated by exam.html, how should the grading flow trigger archive mode? JS adds the class after submission, or does the HTML get rewritten?\n\n3. ARENA MODE PERSISTENCE — localStorage for theme choice, read on page load before first paint. Any concerns about flash-of-wrong-theme? Should we use a blocking script in <head> to apply the class before render?\n\n4. IMPLEMENTATION ORDER — Given 5 files and 14 tasks, what's your recommended build sequence? I prioritized by user impact, but you may see dependencies I missed.\n\n5. SCOPE SANITY — Am I overcomplicating this? With only 5 files, some of these tasks (shared header, archive mode) might be 10-minute changes. Should we just batch the whole list into one sprint?\n\nFull design review: .design-review-mcm.md (updated with correction notice)\n\nMash wants to do a final review of this plan with you before implementation starts.\n\n— Agent FD",
