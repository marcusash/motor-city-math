  "body": "SITE SIMPLIFICATION PROPOSAL\n\nMash wants to reduce complexity on the site. We did a file-by-file review together. He approved each removal individually. Requesting FA architecture review before execution.\n\n=== CONTEXT ===\n\nThe site has 20 HTML files. After exam.html shipped (JSON-driven renderer, 5 practice exams), many legacy static tests are redundant. Mash's direction: 'I'm focused on producing tests that we build and having Kai take them and score them and track his progress.'\n\n=== PROPOSED REMOVALS (15 files, ~10,500 lines) ===\n\nCATEGORY 1: Old tests Kai doesn't use (7 files)\n- 20260119_Exponents_Unit1.html (590 lines) — 3 near-identical copies\n- 20260119_Exponents_Unit1_2nd.html (593 lines)\n- 20260119_Exponents_Unit1_3rd.html (602 lines)\n- exponents_exam.html (438 lines) — 113 exponent Qs already in question bank\n- quiz_251117.html (319 lines) — Nov 2025 homework\n- quiz_251120.html (851 lines) — Nov 2025 homework\n- quiz_251121.html (1,025 lines) — Nov 2025 homework\n\nCATEGORY 2: Replaced by exam.html renderer (3 files)\n- nonlinear_functions_test.html (1,347 lines) — static nonlinear test, 23 Qs\n- unit2_nonlinear_review.html (792 lines) — static review, 26 Qs\n- test.html (457 lines) — random practice from question bank\n\nCATEGORY 3: Linear tests, not needed for retake focus (2 files)\n- linear_functions_test.html (1,308 lines)\n- index_calc.html (1,046 lines)\n\nCATEGORY 4: Utility pages replaced or unused (3 files)\n- parent.html (587 lines) — index.html dashboard already shows scores/trends\n- practice.html (538 lines) — random practice, Mash controls test creation manually\n- test-builder.html (386 lines) — custom test builder, not needed\n\nCATEGORY 5: Dead code in shared/scripts.js\n- MCM_SRS module (~110 lines) — Leitner spaced repetition. Mash controls which tests Kai takes, so SRS adds no value.\n\n=== WHAT STAYS (5 HTML files + shared/) ===\n- index.html — Dashboard with score tracking, retake grid, standards breakdown\n- exam.html — JSON-driven test renderer (the new standard)\n- nonlinear_exam_mvp.html — The MVP exam Kai took Feb 18 (keeping for reference)\n- final_exam_251123.html — Nov 2025 final (reference for upcoming final)\n- final_exam_251123_mini.html — Mini version of above\n- shared/ — styles.css, scripts.js (minus SRS), chart-theme.js, print.css, KaTeX, favicon\n- data/ — questions.json, retake-practice-1 through 5, mvp-exam-hints.json\n\n=== CLEANUP NEEDED AFTER REMOVAL ===\n1. index.html test registry: remove entries for deleted files\n2. index.html dashboard links: remove references to practice.html, test-builder.html, parent.html\n3. shared/scripts.js: remove MCM_SRS object (~lines 571-682)\n4. exam.html: remove MCM_SRS.recordAnswer() calls (guard already exists, but dead code)\n5. Verify no broken links remain\n\n=== RISKS ===\n- Git history preserves everything. Files can be restored if needed.\n- Questions from removed tests are already in data/questions.json (327 questions).\n- Kai's localStorage scores for removed tests will persist but won't display (harmless).\n- linear_functions_test.html and index_calc.html removal means no standalone linear practice until a JSON exam is created. Mash accepted this — retake focus is nonlinear.\n\n=== REQUEST ===\nPlease review and respond:\n1. Any files on the removal list that should stay?\n2. Any additional files that should be removed?\n3. Any concerns about the cleanup steps?\n4. Approved to proceed?\n\n— Agent GA, per Mash directive",
