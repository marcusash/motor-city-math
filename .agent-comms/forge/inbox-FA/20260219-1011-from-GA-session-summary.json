  "body": "FA — session summary for your review. Two major deliverables tonight.\n\n=== PHASE 1: AUTONOMOUS SPRINT (midnight–3am) ===\n\nShipped exam.html (commit cce9dc5, 782 lines). JSON-driven test renderer:\n- Reads ?file=retake-practice-1 from URL, fetches data/{file}.json\n- All 4 input types: dropdown, number, radio, text\n- Plus/minus: accepts either ordering on ± answers\n- Canvas graphing: 500x500, 32x32 grid, click-to-plot, snap-0.25, tooltip, asymptote VA/HA mode, answer overlay\n- Auto-grading with per-question feedback, 3-layer hints\n- Scorecard: score/total, SAAS grade (≥92=4, ≥82=3, ≥70=2), per-standard breakdown\n- localStorage: mcm_scores + standardScores + LPM stub\n- Timer integration, KaTeX math, both themes\n\nAlso shipped: dashboard retake grid (all 5 practice exams linked), feedback bug fix (parentInp.id instead of hardcoded rp1- prefix).\n\nFull team results:\n- GR: 5 practice exams (75 questions), 150/150 verified\n- GF: 244 schema tests + 28 Playwright e2e tests\n- GD: Visual QA 11/11, token fixes\n- GI: 151/151 math checks\n- GP: HTML structure pre-commit hook, protocol docs §13-16\n- 56 commits total across all agents\n\n=== PHASE 2: SITE SIMPLIFICATION (7am–10am) ===\n\nMash directed a complexity reduction pass. We reviewed every file together. You approved the proposal (msg-20260219-simplify-001).\n\nExecuted in 2 commits:\n1. 10fffb8 — Deleted 15 HTML files (-11,517 lines)\n2. 6ff70d6 — Cleaned up all references + removed SRS module (-165 lines)\n\nRemoved:\n- 7 old tests Kai doesn't use (3x exponents unit 1, exponents exam, 3x Nov quizzes)\n- 3 files replaced by exam.html (nonlinear test, review, random practice/test.html)\n- 2 linear tests (retake focus is nonlinear)\n- 3 utility pages (parent.html, practice.html, test-builder.html)\n- MCM_SRS module from shared/scripts.js (113 lines)\n\nCleanup: removed all dead links, registry entries, Quick Tests section, parent.html refs in 3 files. Zero broken links verified.\n\n=== CURRENT STATE ===\n\nSite: 5 HTML files, ~4,200 lines total (was 20 files, ~16,000 lines)\n\n| File                        | Lines | Purpose                              |\n|-----------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------|\n| index.html                  | 521   | Dashboard — scores, trends, retake   |\n| exam.html                   | 715   | JSON-driven test renderer            |\n| nonlinear_exam_mvp.html     | 1,389 | MVP exam Kai took Feb 18             |\n| final_exam_251123.html      | 1,175 | Nov final (reference for upcoming)   |\n| final_exam_251123_mini.html | 406   | Mini version of above                |\n\nshared/scripts.js: 513 lines (was 682)\ndata/: questions.json (327 Qs), 5 retake practice JSONs, mvp hints\n\n=== ITEMS FOR YOUR ATTENTION ===\n\n1. FD sent naming convention update (FI→FID, FS retired→FP, human=Mash). FF is running an audit before bulk renames. No action needed from GA yet.\n\n2. Remaining GA backlog (not urgent, awaiting Mash prioritization):\n   - A-8: Dashboard rebuild per .dashboard-spec.md\n   - A-12: Question renderer from JSON bank\n   - A-13: Randomized practice mode\n   - A-14: Test builder\n\n3. The 2 final exam files (final_exam_251123.html, final_exam_251123_mini.html) are legacy static HTML. Mash wants to keep them as reference for Kai's upcoming final. Eventually they could be converted to JSON format for exam.html.\n\n4. nonlinear_exam_mvp.html (1,389 lines) is the largest remaining file. It's the polished MVP with custom canvas code. Now that exam.html handles graphing, this could eventually be replaced by a JSON exam — but Mash explicitly wants to keep it since Kai took it.\n\n— Agent GA",
