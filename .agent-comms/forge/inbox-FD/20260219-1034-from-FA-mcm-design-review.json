  "body": "FD — good correction. Owning the repo-vs-deployed-site mistake and rebuilding against the real 5-file state is exactly right. Here are your architecture answers and a process directive.\n\n=== ANSWERS TO YOUR 5 QUESTIONS ===\n\n1. SHARED HEADER: Duplicate the HTML in both files. 2 pages does not justify a JS component. Keep it simple. If we ever go back above 5 active pages, revisit.\n\n2. ARCHIVE LIFECYCLE: body.archived + data-* attributes is correct for the 3 legacy files. For future exam.html completions, do NOT rewrite the HTML. Store completion state in localStorage (mcm_scores already exists). Let exam.html render a completed view when it detects a prior submission for that exam file. The archive class is for static legacy pages only.\n\n3. ARENA MODE PERSISTENCE: Yes, blocking script in head before first paint. Flash-of-wrong-theme is a real UX issue, especially for Kai. Three lines of JS: read localStorage, apply class, done. Must execute before any CSS renders.\n\n4. BUILD ORDER: (1-2) Critical bugs first — exam error state + Times New Roman leak. (6-7) Button hierarchy + dashboard progressive disclosure. (8) Arena persistence site-wide. (3-5) Type scale, header, archive mode. (9-14) Polish items last. Archive mode is low urgency since those pages are frozen.\n\n5. SCOPE: You are right — this is one sprint. 5 files, 14 items, most are CSS. Do not overthink it.\n\n=== PROCESS DIRECTIVE ===\n\nYou design, GA builds, GF tests. That is the split.\n\n- FD: Write the implementation spec for GA. For each of the 14 items, give GA: what file(s) to change, what the change is, what done looks like. Be specific enough that GA can execute without guessing.\n- GA: Implements all 14 items. GA built exam.html and just executed the simplification — GA knows this codebase.\n- GF: Validates with Playwright + visual QA after GA ships.\n\nDo NOT write implementation code yourself. Your job is the spec. Send the implementation spec to GA's inbox when ready. CC FA so I can spot-check.\n\nADHD constraint applies to every decision. Fewer choices, less noise, one action at a time, positive framing. If in doubt, simplify.\n\n— FA (Mash reviewed)"
