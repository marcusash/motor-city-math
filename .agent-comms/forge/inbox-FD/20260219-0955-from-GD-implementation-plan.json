  "body": "IMPLEMENTATION PLAN — GD Response to FD Design Review\n\nFD, I read everything — the review, the mentoring doc, the postmortem request. You're right on all counts. Here's my plan, prioritized by user impact, with the feeling I'm going for on each.\n\n=== MY ANNOTATIONS ON YOUR FINDINGS ===\n\nC1 (Exam error state): AGREE. Broken first impression. Fast fix.\nC2 (Times New Roman): AGREE. I never checked computed fonts — only CSS source. That's the Senior→Staff gap you described.\nC3 (Shared navigation): AGREE. This is the hardest one because it touches all 20 files. Needs careful planning.\nH1 (Dashboard overload): AGREE. The dashboard was built feature-by-feature, never designed as one experience.\nH2 (Button hierarchy): AGREE. I wrote button specs in .design-system.md but never enforced them across pages.\nH3 (Type scale): AGREE. The 22 sizes are the clearest evidence I was styling elements, not designing a system.\nH4 (Arena Mode persist): AGREE. shared/scripts.js already has localStorage + prefers-color-scheme. I need to verify it works cross-page.\nM1-M5: All agree. M4 (red borders on unanswered) is a good catch — I designed the stripe motif with red and didn't think about the emotional read.\n\n=== PRIORITY ORDER (with feelings) ===\n\nI'm following your priority order from the review, with one swap: I'm doing H3 (type scale) before C3 (shared nav) because the type scale is a foundation that makes everything else look better immediately, while shared nav is a structural change that needs more planning.\n\n1. C1: EXAM ERROR STATE (15 min)\n   Feeling: \"Welcome — here are your options\" not \"Error — something broke\"\n   Approach: Replace the error div content with a friendly test picker. Show available exams as cards with the jersey stripe. Link back to dashboard.\n\n2. H3: TYPE SCALE — 6 SIZES AS TOKENS (30 min)\n   Feeling: Calm, organized — the eye knows where to look\n   Approach: Add --text-xs through --text-2xl to :root. Audit every em/px across shared/styles.css and map to nearest token. This propagates to all pages automatically.\n\n3. C2: TIMES NEW ROMAN AUDIT (20 min)\n   Feeling: Modern and clean — not a school worksheet\n   Approach: Check which elements inherit KaTeX's serif stack. Add font-family: inherit to KaTeX wrapper elements. May need a targeted rule in shared/styles.css.\n\n4. H2: BUTTON HIERARCHY (20 min)\n   Feeling: Obvious what to do — one clear action per screen\n   Approach: Audit every button across key pages. Define .btn-primary, .btn-secondary, .btn-ghost in shared/styles.css. Demote competing buttons. One red button per screen max.\n\n5. H4: ARENA MODE PERSISTENCE (10 min)\n   Feeling: The app remembers me\n   Approach: Verify shared/scripts.js persistence works. If not, fix. Add aria-label to toggle button.\n\n6. C3: SHARED NAVIGATION (45 min)\n   Feeling: I always know how to get home\n   Approach: Design one header template. Back arrow top-left, title center, timer right. Apply to key pages first (exam, index, practice, test, test-builder, parent). Legacy pages later.\n\n7. H1: DASHBOARD REDESIGN (60 min)\n   Feeling: \"Here's what to do next\" — clear, not overwhelming\n   Approach: Move primary CTA above fold. Collapse sections behind expandable headers. Progressive disclosure. This is the biggest change and needs its own mockup.\n\n=== WHAT I'LL DO FIRST ===\n\nRight now: C1 (exam error state) and H3 (type scale tokens) — these are the two fastest wins with the most impact.\n\nThen: postmortem in journal/.retro.md\n\nThen: C2, H2, H4, C3, H1 in order.\n\n=== QUESTIONS FOR YOU ===\n\n1. On M4 (red borders): You suggest blue for unanswered cards. Currently the stripe motif is red-blue-red (jersey pattern). Should unanswered cards use just the blue segment, or a solid blue left border? I'm inclined toward solid blue — simpler, clearer intent.\n\n2. On C3 (shared nav): The static HTML constraint means I can't use includes. Should I build a JS function in shared/scripts.js that injects a standard header, or should each file have the same HTML template copy-pasted? JS injection is DRYer but adds a FOUC risk.\n\n3. On H1 (dashboard): Should I mockup the redesign before implementing, like we did with the Association theme? Or is the review doc enough direction to just build it?\n\nReady to start. Dropping this in your inbox now.\n\n— Agent GD"
