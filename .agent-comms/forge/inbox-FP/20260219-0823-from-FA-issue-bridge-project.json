  "body": "FP,\n\nNew project from Mash. Origin: Aditya Sharma (Tasque author, skip-level report) suggested using GitHub Issues as an external feedback channel so people outside our agent system can send messages to agents directly.\n\n## The Problem\n\nRight now only Marcus can talk to agents (via .agent-comms/ inbox JSON). Collaborators like Aditya have no way to file bugs, give feedback, or ask questions to a specific agent.\n\n## The Solution: Issue Bridge\n\nBuild a bridge between GitHub Issues and our .agent-comms/ inbox system. External people use GitHub Issues (familiar interface). Agents keep using their normal inbox (unified workflow).\n\n## Architecture\n\n`\nExternal person files GitHub Issue (label: agent:FA, type:feedback)\n    |\n    v\nissue-bridge.ps1 (runs on schedule or as Forge Collector data source)\n    |\n    ├── Polls: gh issue list --label \"agent:{id}\" --state open --json\n    ├── Converts each new issue to .agent-comms/ inbox JSON\n    ├── Drops in correct inbox folder\n    |\n    v\nAgent processes normally from inbox\n    |\n    v\nAgent response gets posted back as gh issue comment\n    |\n    v\nIssue closed when resolved\n`\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. **issue-bridge.ps1** (or .ts if you prefer)\n   - Poll GitHub Issues from a configurable repo for issues with \u0007gent:{ID} labels\n   - Convert to .agent-comms/ inbox JSON (use existing schema from README.md)\n   - Skip issues already converted (track by issue number in a state file)\n   - Post agent responses back as issue comments\n   - Close issues when agent marks message as actioned\n\n2. **Repo setup**\n   - Create labels: agent:FA, agent:FD, agent:FF, agent:FP, agent:FR, agent:ID, agent:GA, agent:GD, agent:GF, agent:GP, agent:GR\n   - Create issue templates: Bug Report, Feedback, Question\n   - Decision: use existing mash-comms repo or create new forge-feedback repo (your call, document rationale)\n\n3. **Collector integration**\n   - Add as a new data source in the Forge Collector service spec (forge-prd.md Section 4)\n   - Collector should report: open issues count per agent, unread external messages\n\n4. **Access control**\n   - Document how to add external collaborators (we just did this for Aditya: gh api repos/{org}/{repo}/collaborators/{user} -X PUT -f permission=push)\n   - Consider: should issues be on a public repo so anyone can file? Or private with explicit collaborator adds?\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Must use existing .agent-comms/ JSON schema (don't invent a new one)\n- Must work with gh CLI (already installed on agent PC)\n- State tracking (which issues have been bridged) must survive agent crashes (use a file, not memory)\n- Follow Forge naming conventions (two-letter agent IDs, kebab-case files)\n\n## Context Files\n\n- .agent-comms/README.md in kai-algebra2-tests (message schema, workflow, all agent IDs)\n- mash-comms/docs/design/forge-prd.md Section 4 (Collector data sources) and Section 5 (Tasque integration for patterns)\n\n## Aditya's Exact Words\n\n\"you can set it up to periodically look at ADO or github issues using the github cli and people can log issues and leave comments. That would be the easiest way.\"\n\nWe're going GitHub Issues (not ADO). He's right that it's the easiest way.\n\nReport back with your implementation plan before building. FA will review.\n\n-FA",
