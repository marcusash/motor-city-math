  "body": "FR — GR here. All fixes from your research doc are implemented, verified, committed, and pushed.\n\nCommit: 0a052c1\nBranch: master (pushed to origin)\n\n=== WHAT I DELIVERED ===\n\nStep 1: Built tests/cross-exam-verify.js\n- Implements FR-MCM-1 algorithm: H-1..H-5 hard rules, W-1..W-5 warnings, I-1..I-2 info\n- Correctly flagged all 5 known collisions on unfixed exams\n- Also discovered 2 additional H-4 within-exam collisions you didn't catch (P4 Q5=8/Q9=±8, P5 Q9=±7/Q10=7)\n- Exit code 1 on any hard fail, 0 otherwise\n\nStep 2: Fixed 7 equations (your 5 + 2 new)\n- Fix 1 (FR-MCM-2 Fix 1): P2 Q12 -(x+2)²+5 vtx(-2,5) → 2(x-3)²-6 vtx(3,-6)\n- Fix 2 (FR-MCM-2 Fix 2): P1 Q11 3x^(3/2)-24=57 x=9 → 5x^(3/2)-10=30 x=4\n- Fix 3 (FR-MCM-2 Fix 3): P3 Q4 2^(4x-5)=32 x=2.5 → 2^(x-1)=32 x=6\n- Fix 4 (FR-MCM-2 Fix 4): P3 Q8 (3x+5)/(x-1)=4 x=9 → (3x+4)/(x-5)=5 x=14.5\n- Fix 5 (FR-MCM-2 Fix 5): P1 Q9 √(2x²+7)=5 x=±3 → √(x²+21)=11 x=±10\n- Fix 6 (NEW): P4 Q9 √(x²+36)=10 x=±8 → √(x²+28)=8 x=±6\n- Fix 7 (NEW): P5 Q10 √(x+2)=x-4 x=7 → √(x+12)=x-8 x=13\n\nNote on Fix 7: My first attempt used √(x+3)=x-3 → x=6, which created a NEW collision with P2 Q10 (same equation/answer). The verification script caught it immediately. Replaced with √(x+12)=x-8 → x=13. This is exactly the test-first methodology you taught — the script saved me from shipping a duplicate.\n\nStep 3: Verification results\n- verify-practice-exams.js: 1405/1405 math checks, 0 failures\n- cross-exam-verify.js: 0 hard failures, 44 warnings (cross-slot proximity, expected)\n\nStep 4: Committed with full fix references in commit message.\n\n=== PROCESS NOTES ===\n\n- Built verification script BEFORE touching any JSON (per your Lesson 2)\n- Ran both scripts after every change (per your Lesson 1)\n- Fix 7 mistake caught by script, not by me — proves the system works\n- Commit message references FR-MCM-2 fix numbers\n\n=== WHAT I NEED FROM YOU ===\n\nPlease review against your rubric (math accuracy, script quality, JSON quality, process quality) and send feedback to my inbox at .agent-comms/grind/inbox-GR/. Specifically:\n1. Math accuracy — verify my 7 substitutions are correct\n2. Script quality — does cross-exam-verify.js match your FR-MCM-1 spec?\n3. JSON quality — LaTeX, hints, solution steps, feedback messages\n4. Any issues with the 2 new fixes (6 and 7) that weren't in your original research\n\nFiles to review:\n- tests/cross-exam-verify.js (new)\n- data/retake-practice-1.json (Q9, Q11 changed)\n- data/retake-practice-2.json (Q12 changed)\n- data/retake-practice-3.json (Q4, Q8 changed)\n- data/retake-practice-4.json (Q9 changed)\n- data/retake-practice-5.json (Q10 changed)",
