  "body": "NAMING AUDIT — COMPREHENSIVE BRIEF FOR AGENT FF\n\nFrom: Mash (via Agent FD)\nPriority: HIGH — this is your next task.\n\n=== CONTEXT ===\n\nWe locked agent naming conventions (FID three-letter exception, FS retired into FP, Mash as human lead name). FD updated the canonical registry and ~10 files, but the cleanup was incomplete. Naming drift was found by a Grind agent who had 'ID' instead of 'FID' in their Forge roster. Mash wants a THOROUGH audit with fresh eyes.\n\nA broadcast has been sent to all agents (Forge + Grind, 17 inboxes) with the current rules. Your job is to verify reality matches the rules, find every violation, and produce a task list.\n\n=== YOUR DELIVERABLES ===\n\n1. AUDIT REPORT — a complete inventory of naming violations across all repos:\n   - C:\\Github\\journal (Inkwell)\n   - C:\\Github\\mash-comms (Forge comms/voice)\n   - C:\\Github\\kai-algebra2-tests (Motor City Math)\n   - C:\\Github\\drlt-offsites (Offsite decks)\n   - Any other repos in C:\\Github\\ that reference agent names\n\n2. TASK LIST — specific, actionable tasks assigned to each agent:\n   - What file, what line, what the current text says, what it should say\n   - Grouped by agent (who owns each file)\n   - Prioritized: P0 (actively confusing agents) > P1 (wrong but not blocking) > P2 (historical, cosmetic)\n\n3. TEST PLAN — automated validation:\n   - naming-lint.ps1: scan all repos for stale patterns (Agent A, Agent D, Agent I, Agent S, FI without D, FS, inbox-ID)\n   - naming-validate.ps1: verify canonical registry matches reality (all .agents.md files, all inbox directory names, all protocol files)\n   - These scripts should be runnable by any agent and produce PASS/FAIL output\n\n=== KNOWN ISSUES (starting points, not exhaustive) ===\n\n1. inbox-ID directories should be inbox-FID:\n   - C:\\Github\\journal\\.agent-comms\\inbox-ID\\\n   - C:\\Github\\kai-algebra2-tests\\.agent-comms\\forge\\inbox-ID\\\n   \n2. agent-memo-forge-suite.md header still says 'All Forge agents (A, D, F, ID, P, R)' — old IDs\n\n3. .forge-architecture.md may still have stale references (FD updated some but not all)\n\n4. Grind agent had Forge 'Data Lead' listed as 'ID' not 'FID' — means .agents.md or equivalent in MCM repo is wrong\n\n5. ~200+ references to old single-letter IDs in journal repo (mostly in docs/agents/status.md — historical, low priority but should be cataloged)\n\n6. Message type instructions and voice guide — FD updated these but should be verified\n\n7. Dispatch repo (C:\\Github\\dispatch or wherever it lives) — may have old naming\n\n=== CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH ===\n\nmash-comms/.agent-aliases.md — this file WINS over everything.\n\nActive Forge roster:\n  FA  — Application     — Chief Architect\n  FD  — Design + Comms  — Design Director\n  FF  — Fundamentals    — Quality Lead\n  FID — Identity & Data — Data & Identification Lead\n  FP  — Platform        — Security & Ops Lead\n  FR  — Research        — Research Lead\n\nRetired:\n  FS → merged into FP (Platform)\n  FI → promoted to FID (Identity & Data)\n\nHuman lead: Mash (not Marcus in agent-facing docs)\n\nGrind roster (separate org, MCM project):\n  GA, GD, GF, GI, GP, GR, GS — all correct as-is\n\n=== WHAT FF SHOULD NOT DO ===\n\n- Do NOT bulk-rename old git commits or historical status entries\n- Do NOT rename inbox-ID directories yourself — flag them and FP will handle (requires updating all agents' configs)\n- Do NOT modify voice guide or message type instructions — flag issues and FD will fix\n- Focus on FINDING and DOCUMENTING. The task list you produce will be distributed to the right owners.\n\n=== TIMELINE ===\n\nThis is your next task. Deliver the audit report + task list first, test scripts second. Mash is waiting on this before approving any further naming work.\n\n=== EXISTING BRIEF (supplementary) ===\n\nThere is a prior brief at mash-comms/docs/ff-brief-naming-audit.md with a truth table and stale patterns. Use it as a starting point but do your own thorough scan — that brief was written before we found the Grind-side drift.\n\n— Mash (via FD)",
