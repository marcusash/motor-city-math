# Motor City Math — Agent Registry

> This file is the master registry for all agents working on this project.
> Every agent reads this on startup. Every agent owns their section in `.agent-status.md`.

---

## Organization Structure

Motor City Math is a project under **Grind** (Marcus's learning tools org). **Forge** is Marcus's leadership team — they float across all projects to review, mentor, architect, and tackle the hardest problems.

| Org | Prefix | Role |
|-----|--------|------|
| **Forge** | `F` | Leadership team. Cross-project architecture, reviews, quality standards. |
| **Grind** | `G` | Project team. Dedicated builders for MCM and future learning tools. |

Agent IDs: `{org-prefix}{role-initial}` — globally unique across all Marcus projects.

### ID Migration (old → new)

| Old ID | New ID | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| A | **GA** | Application Engineer |
| A2 | **FA** | Was "Staff Engineer" — actually Forge Chief Architect working cross-project |
| D | **GD** | Design Agent |
| F | **GF** | Fundamentals/QA Agent |
| I | **GI** | Importer Agent |
| P | **GP** | Platform Agent |
| R | **GR** | Research/Math Agent |
| S | **GS** | Security Agent |

## Rules (Enforced)

1. **One owner per file.** If you need to change a file you don't own, post a request in `.agent-status.md` with the exact change needed.
2. **Status board is the source of truth.** Update your section in `.agent-status.md` after every task. Use `- [x]` for done, `- [ ]` for in progress.
3. **Check dependencies before starting.** Read `.agent-status.md` for other agents' progress. Don't build on uncommitted work.
4. **Bug reports go in the bugs table.** Use `.agent-status.md` → Bugs section. Include: severity, reproduction steps, which file.
5. **No secrets in source.** No API keys, no personal data, no student info beyond first name.
6. **Build/verify before marking DONE.** Open the HTML in a browser. Check it works. Check print layout. Then mark done.
7. **Math accuracy is non-negotiable.** Every answer, every solution, every hint must be mathematically correct. Research agent verifies all content.

## How to Add a New Agent

1. Assign an ID using the `{org-prefix}{role-initial}` convention
2. Add a row to the appropriate Active Agents table above
3. Create a section in `.agent-status.md` with the header format: `## {agent-name} Status`
4. Create an inbox folder at `.agent-comms/{org}/inbox-{ID}/`
5. Add file ownership rows for any new files
6. Read `.agent-protocol.md` for communication rules (especially §12 Inbox System)
7. Read `.agent-comms/README.md` for message schema
8. Read `.project-review.md` for project context
9. Read `.design-system.md` for visual specs
10. Post your first task list in your status section
