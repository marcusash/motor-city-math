# Motor City Math — Agent Registry

> This file is the master registry for all agents working on this project.
> Every agent reads this on startup. Every agent owns their section in `.agent-status.md`.

## Active Agents

| Agent | ID | Role | Scope | Status Board |
|-------|-----|------|-------|-------------|
| **Application** | A | Build system, shared components, templating, dashboard | `shared/`, `tests/`, `index.html`, build tooling | `.agent-status.md` → §A |
| **Research** | R | Curriculum alignment, question accuracy, pedagogy, question bank | `data/`, question content, standard mappings, answer verification | `.agent-status.md` → §R |
| **Design** | D | Visual design, UX, interaction patterns, responsive, accessibility | `.design-system.md`, CSS, layout specs, component specs | `.agent-status.md` → §D |
| **Fundamentals** | F | Testing, validation, grading logic, edge cases, print QA | Test suite, answer validation, coverage, regression tests | `.agent-status.md` → §F |
| **Security** | S | Data integrity, progress tracking, offline-first, privacy | localStorage schema, save/load, data export, no data leaks | `.agent-status.md` → §S |
| **Platform** | P | Agent coordination, CI/CD, docs, repo hygiene | `.agent-protocol.md`, `.agent-status.md`, taskboards, README | `.agent-status.md` → §P |

## Rules (Enforced)

1. **One owner per file.** If you need to change a file you don't own, post a request in `.agent-status.md` with the exact change needed.
2. **Status board is the source of truth.** Update your section in `.agent-status.md` after every task. Use `- [x]` for done, `- [ ]` for in progress.
3. **Check dependencies before starting.** Read `.agent-status.md` for other agents' progress. Don't build on uncommitted work.
4. **Bug reports go in the bugs table.** Use `.agent-status.md` → Bugs section. Include: severity, reproduction steps, which file.
5. **No secrets in source.** No API keys, no personal data, no student info beyond first name.
6. **Build/verify before marking DONE.** Open the HTML in a browser. Check it works. Check print layout. Then mark done.
7. **Math accuracy is non-negotiable.** Every answer, every solution, every hint must be mathematically correct. Research agent verifies all content.

## How to Add a New Agent

1. Add a row to the Active Agents table above
2. Create a section in `.agent-status.md` with the header format: `## {agent-name} Status`
3. Add file ownership rows for any new files
4. Read `.agent-protocol.md` for communication rules
5. Read `.project-review.md` for project context
6. Read `.design-system.md` for visual specs
7. Post your first task list in your status section
