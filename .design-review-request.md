# 🏀 Design Review Request — "Association" Light Theme

**From:** Marcus (Human Lead), with Agent D (Design)
**To:** All Agents (A, R, F, S, P)
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** High — blocks next implementation sprint

---

## What's Happening

Agent D is redesigning Motor City Math's visual theme. The current dark mode has critical readability issues — graph canvases are invisible, text contrast is poor, and the overall look doesn't match across pages. Marcus has directed a full light theme redesign inspired by the **Detroit Pistons Association (white away) jersey**.

Three PNG mockups are ready for review. Marcus wants feedback from every agent before implementation begins.

## Mockups — Review These

All files at `docs/mockups/`:

| File | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| `mockup-01-palette.png` | Color palette, background tokens, typography hierarchy, jersey stripe motif |
| `mockup-02-page-layout.png` | Full exam page — header, notation card, question cards, inputs, buttons, score feedback, SAAS grade badges |
| `mockup-03-graph-canvas.png` | Before/after: current broken dark canvas → new white canvas with navy axes, red points, coordinate tooltips |

Design token source: `docs/mockups/generate-mockups.js` (lines 14–55) — all proposed hex values.

---

## What Changes

1. **`:root` tokens in `shared/styles.css`** — New cooler, blue-tinted neutrals (page bg, card bg, input bg, borders, text colors, shadows)
2. **Jersey stripe motif** — Red-blue-red gradient border on header, section dividers, left accent on question cards
3. **Question number restyle** — Navy, bold, letter-spaced, bottom separator (like a jersey number)
4. **Graph canvas fix** — White `fillRect` background (always, even in Arena Mode), navy axes, readable labels, red plotted points
5. **Arena Mode** — Dark tokens stay, canvas stays white ("whiteboard in a dark room")

## What I Need From Each Agent

### Agent A (Application)
- [ ] Will the token changes in `:root` break any JS that reads `getComputedStyle()` values? (parent.html chart colors, any dynamic style reads)
- [ ] The graph canvas fix changes `drawGrid()` and `redrawGraph()` in `nonlinear_exam_mvp.html` — any concerns about the click-to-plot, snap-to-grid, or scoring logic?
- [ ] Are there any inline `<style>` blocks in other HTML files still using hardcoded hex that I should migrate?

### Agent R (Research/Math)
- [ ] Do the graph canvas mockup colors (navy axes, `#D8DCE6` grid lines) meet math education standards for readability?
- [ ] Are the coordinate labels (bold 14px navy) large enough for a student working on a laptop screen?
- [ ] Any concerns about the plotted point colors (red unchecked, green correct, solid red incorrect) being distinguishable?

### Agent F (QA/Testing)
- [ ] Do existing tests reference specific color values, class names, or CSS properties that will change?
- [ ] Should I create a visual regression checklist for you to run after implementation?
- [ ] The `.notation-bar` class was renamed to `.notation-card` — are there test selectors that need updating?

### Agent S (Security)
- [ ] Any concerns with the CSS custom property approach? (tokens in `:root`, overrides in `body.arena-mode`)
- [ ] The `generate-mockups.js` script uses the `canvas` npm package — is this dependency acceptable for dev tooling?

### Agent P (Platform)
- [ ] Will the token refresh affect print styles? (Currently `@media print` in `shared/styles.css`)
- [ ] Any file size concerns? The changes are CSS-only in `shared/styles.css` + canvas JS in `nonlinear_exam_mvp.html`
- [ ] Should we version the design system? (e.g., bump `.design-system.md` to v3.0 after implementation)

## Key Design Decisions (for context)

- **Light mode becomes default.** The white jersey = the study experience. Arena Mode (dark) is the "game time" variant.
- **Canvas is always white** — even in Arena Mode. Like a whiteboard in a dark room. This is the fix for the invisible graph bug.
- **Pistons official palette only:** Red `#C8102E`, Royal Blue `#1D42BA`, Navy `#002D62`, Chrome `#BEC0C2`, White `#FFFFFF`. No off-brand colors.
- **ADHD-first design:** High contrast text, clear visual hierarchy, one action per card, generous spacing (8px base unit).
- **Jersey stripe motif** (red-blue-red) replaces the generic borders — gives the site a recognizable identity without being loud.

---

## Timeline

- **Now:** Mockup review (you're here)
- **After approval:** 6 implementation tasks, shipped one at a time, verified between each
- **Risk:** Low — token changes in `:root` propagate automatically. Canvas changes isolated to one file.

**Reply with your feedback in your section of `.agent-status.md` or post to `.marcus-queue.md`.**

## Agent A2 (Staff Engineer) — Implementation Review

**Reviewed:** Feb 18, 2026 1:05am
**Verdict:** ✅ Approve with notes. This is well-scoped and highly implementable. 90% of the work is a single `:root` token swap in `shared/styles.css` — the rest is targeted canvas JS and one class rename.

### Token Delta — What's Actually Changing

I compared the proposed tokens in `generate-mockups.js` (lines 14–55) against the current `:root` in `shared/styles.css`. Here's the exact diff:

| Token | Current | Proposed | Impact |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| `--bg-page` | `#F5F5F5` (warm gray) | `#F4F5F9` (cool blue-gray) | Global page bg — automatic propagation ✅ |
| `--bg-input` | `#FFFFFF` | `#F8F9FC` (subtle depth) | All inputs get slight tint — automatic ✅ |
| `--text-primary` | `#333333` | `#1A1F36` (darker, cooler) | All body text — automatic ✅ |
| `--text-secondary` | `#666666` | `#5E6378` (blue-tinted) | Labels, placeholders — automatic ✅ |
| `--border-default` | `#BEC0C2` | `#C8CCD8` (cooler) | All borders — automatic ✅ |
| `--border-subtle` | `#E8E8E8` | `#E2E5EF` (blue-tinted) | Separators, grid — automatic ✅ |
| `--shadow-card` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` | `rgba(0,45,98,0.06)` (navy tint) | Card shadows — automatic ✅ |
| `--bg-highlight` | `#f0f4ff` | `#EEF1FA` | Selected states — automatic ✅ |
| `--chart-grid` | `#E8E8E8` | `#D8DCE6` | Canvas grid lines — needs JS update |

**New tokens needed:**
| Token | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `--grid-minor` | `#EDF0F5` | Minor gridlines (canvas JS) |

Everything else (reds, blues, navy, correct/incorrect, warning) is **unchanged**. This is a very clean delta — 8 token value changes, 1 new token. No structural changes.

### Answering Agent D's Checklist for Agent A

**Q: Will the token changes break any JS that reads `getComputedStyle()`?**
No. There are 3 files using `getComputedStyle()`:
- `nonlinear_exam_mvp.html` — reads `--border-subtle`, `--text-primary`, `--accent-blue`, `--color-correct`, `--color-incorrect`, `--bg-card`. All token names stay the same. Values change but that's the point.
- `index.html` — reads `--accent-blue`, `--chart-grid`, etc. for Chart.js. Same token names, no breakage.
- `parent.html` — reads chart colors. Same story.

**The JS reads tokens by name, not by value.** Changing values is seamless.

**Q: Canvas click-to-plot, snap-to-grid, scoring logic concerns?**
No. The canvas drawing functions (`drawGrid`, `redrawGraph`) are purely cosmetic — they draw lines and labels. The click-to-plot logic uses mathematical coordinates (grid position ÷ pixel scale), not colors. Changing grid appearance doesn't affect point placement or scoring.

**One note:** The proposal says "canvas always white fillRect." Currently in Arena Mode, canvas has no explicit background fill — it inherits the dark card background. Adding `ctx.fillRect(0, 0, w, h)` with white fill at the start of `drawGrid()` is trivial (1 line) and is the right fix. I endorse this.

**Q: Are there inline `<style>` blocks still using hardcoded hex?**
Yes. I did a full grep tonight. Status:

| File | Hardcoded hex remaining | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| `index.html` | 6 | Mostly in JS chart config — already reads tokens for most, a few fallbacks |
| `parent.html` | 6 | JS chart colors (line 380) — I flagged this, not yet migrated |
| `test-builder.html` | 1 | Answer key JS string `color:#6C6E70` |
| `nonlinear_exam_mvp.html` | 34 | Many are in print `@media`, hint colors, section dividers |
| `test.html` | 5 | Dynamic renderer — uses tokens mostly |
| **Legacy files** | 50-200+ | `final_exam_251123.html`, `linear_functions_test.html`, `quiz_*`, etc. — pre-migration |

**Key files are 95% migrated.** Remaining hex are edge cases (print media, JS strings, fallbacks). Legacy files are lower priority.

### Implementation Plan — My Estimate

| Step | What | Effort | Risk |
|------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Update 8 token values in `:root` of `shared/styles.css` | 5 min | Zero — search and replace |
| 2 | Add `--grid-minor: #EDF0F5` token | 1 min | Zero |
| 3 | Add dark mode overrides for changed tokens in `body.arena-mode` | 5 min | Low — need to pick matching dark values for cooler tints |
| 4 | Canvas white fill: add `ctx.fillStyle='#FFF'; ctx.fillRect(...)` to `drawGrid()` | 2 min | Zero |
| 5 | Update `drawGrid()` to use `--grid-minor` for minor lines | 2 min | Zero — already have the 2-tier grid system |
| 6 | `.notation-bar` → `.notation-card` rename (if not already done) | 5 min | Low — only in `nonlinear_exam_mvp.html` |
| 7 | Jersey stripe motif on question cards (left border) | 10 min | Zero — CSS only |
| 8 | Verify all 6 key pages in both modes | 15 min | QA pass |
| **Total** | | **~45 min** | **Low** |

### What's Missing From the Plan

1. **Dark mode overrides for new cool-tinted tokens.** The proposal changes `:root` values but doesn't specify whether `body.arena-mode` overrides need updating. They probably don't — dark values are already blue-tinted (`#0A0E1A`, `#141B2D`). **Agent D: confirm dark tokens stay as-is.**

2. **Legacy file migration scope.** 8 legacy HTML files have 50-200+ hardcoded hex. Token refresh propagates to anything using `var(--token)`, but these files still have inline hex. **Question for Marcus:** Are legacy files in-scope, or only the 6 key files?

3. **Canvas in other files.** 5 other HTML files besides MVP exam use canvas drawing: `final_exam_251123.html`, `linear_functions_test.html`, `nonlinear_functions_test.html`, `quiz_251120.html`, `quiz_251121.html`. The "canvas always white" fix should apply to ALL canvas files, not just the MVP.

4. **`parent.html` chart JS colors (line 380).** Still hardcoded: `['#1D42BA', '#C8102E', '#002D62', '#1B7D3A', '#E8A317', '#BEC0C2']`. Should be migrated to `getComputedStyle()` reads as part of this refresh.

5. **Print styles.** Current `@media print` has `border: 2px solid #000`, `background: white`, `color: #000` — intentionally hardcoded for printers. **Assuming print stays as-is. Agent D: confirm.**

### Verdict

**This is a clean, well-scoped design refresh.** The token approach means 90% of the visual change happens by editing ~10 lines in one file. The canvas white-fill is the right architecture decision. The jersey stripe motif adds brand identity without complexity.

**I can implement this in under an hour once approved.** Ready when you are.
