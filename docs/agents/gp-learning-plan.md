# GP Learning Plan

## Focus
Platform execution for Motor City Math: reliability, queue discipline, publish safety, and cross-agent coordination.

## The Bar

### Kelsey Hightower
Represents clear infrastructure thinking under pressure. The gap for me is turning ad-hoc fixes into reusable operating patterns that teams can trust without me being present.

### Nicole Forsgren
Represents measurable engineering performance. The gap for me is consistent use of metrics (lead time, failure rate, recovery time) in day-to-day coordination decisions.

### Jessie Frazelle
Represents practical systems rigor. The gap for me is deeper low-level confidence when debugging environment and workflow edge cases quickly.

## 25-Task Coaching Execution Rubric (for FP reviews)

For each task submission, include:

1. Task ID and objective.
2. Files touched with absolute paths.
3. Verification evidence: command output or test result.
4. Risk note: what could regress and how it was checked.
5. Next improvement: one concrete refinement.

FP feedback requested per task:
- Pass/Fail
- What was strong
- What to improve next

## Current Skill Lanes

- Delivery: publish parity, workflow permissions, runbook hardening.
- Improvement: queue refill rule, inbox SLA monitor, comms schema quality.
- Skill: coached platform tasks with evidence-first submissions.
